0,a,"the next second he had raised the surprised Filipino from off his seat and held him for an instant balanced in the air.“Turn her down-stream,” the midshipman ordered in a hoarse voice, as he flung the struggling man into the water clear of the rocking boat.Maria by a well-timed stroke had instantly spun the canoe about, and all four bent desperately to their paddles. Phil saw the broad-brimmed sombrero of their enemy floating on the surface and a fear instantly filled his thoughts that Salas might not swim. The next second he was reassured; the head of the[226] native covered with thick black hair could be plainly seen swimming toward the far shore; the menacing presence of the crocodile had deterred him from attempting to reach the land but a few strokes away. Every second the lad expected to hear a loud call for help from the outraged officer. Phil,"
1,a,"“You’re too young to be a brigadier-general, although you’ve got a star there on your shoulder-strap.”Phil smiled.[166]“Yes, sentry, I am Captain Perry of the gunboat.”“Sure, sir, you can pass me, any time,” the soldier exclaimed gladly. “That was certainly great work you done in Binalbagan. All the boys is talking about you two officers and Jack O’Neil. I’d like to meet him; he must be a corker.” The sentry had grounded his rifle and now stood at ease talking sociably, very much at home with the young midshipman.“He is here,” Phil replied. “If I may pass my party, I’ll call him.”“Certainly, captain, anything you say goes with me,” the sentry returned enthusiastically.The carriage, followed by the band of a dozen natives, drove down the street away from the city. Phil caught a wave of a hand from the window as he turned and started for the gunboat and his bunk,"
2,a,"Kapay. He was scarcely older than Phil, and yet he held the rank of colonel.“Your name, señor,” she smiled, “is one[210] well known throughout Kapay. In appearance you are not the ogre that you are painted.”Colonel Salas’ white, even teeth gleamed between his thin lips. He felt himself the master of the situation. Here was the proud daughter of Rodriguez complimenting him. His small soul was nourished by the thought that he was feared by all.“Then, señorita,” he said, “if you do not consider me an ogre, will you and your English friends accept the offer of a share in my frugal meal? It is now ready inside.”The midshipmen had watched with beating hearts this plucky girl’s brave fence with the subtle native and as he pronounced the word English he glanced at the silent lads. Phil thought he saw a gleam of joy in his cruel eyes.“They do not"

I never felt such heat.”While the Americans were talking the little steamer slipped noisily down the busy river and out on the bay made famous by Admiral Dewey on that memorable May morning.Corregidor Island lifted itself slowly out of a molten sea to the westward. The “Negros’” bow was pointed out through the southern channel, passing close to the precipitous island, standing like an unbending sentinel on guard between the wide portals of the Bay of Manila.“A few guns"
4,a,"now being idly collected. Into these spacious storehouses the sinews of war for the army of occupation were being hoarded to be afterward redistributed among the small steamers plying between the metropolis, Manila, and the outlying islands of the archipelago.The American army in the Philippines, always too small for the stupendous task before it, was at last, owing to the added disaffection of the tribes in the Southern islands, receiving the attention from home which had long been withheld, and its numbers were being increased by the arrival of every transport from the far-away homeland.“We are here at last, Syd,” Midshipman Philip Perry exclaimed, a ring of triumph in his voice as he turned toward his fellow midshipman, Sydney Monroe. Friends of long[11] standing were these two; for four years at the Naval Academy at Annapolis they had been companions and classmates, and during the past year they had together"
5,a,"never explain his actions. He would doubtless pay for this treachery with his life. But his cruel mind was instantly made up as to his future actions. He feared this American too thoroughly not to take them to the place where the Tagalos under Martinez were encamped; above all else Captain Blynn must be made to believe that he was sincere; all depended upon that. Everything must be sacrificed for his final great ambition. Martinez would not be taken alive. That was a necessity, he would see to that. Once he was killed his part in the night’s expedition must remain a secret among the Americans.Casting from him his first fears he straightened his slight frame and rode boldly, with head erect, beside the American leader.One hour before sunrise Captain Blynn disposed his command in a single circular line about the base of a high hill; its sides[76] were covered"
6,a,"without a second’s hesitation. “What are we to see?” he asked, unable to control his curiosity at the mystery of it all.“Come, you shall discover for yourself,” she said as she moved forward, her hand still in Phil’s, while Sydney held his companion by[152] the coat sleeve and Lopez, as noiseless as an Apache, brought up the rear. “The meeting will not take place for some time, and meanwhile we shall have time to talk.”Silently they moved forward until presently, from the sound of their footfalls, Phil knew that the walls had receded and that they had entered a large chamber.“The stairs, señor,” Maria whispered, and the lads found themselves mounting earthen steps. Again their feet struck wooden boards and they knew that they had ascended from the passage and were in a large room directly over the one which they had just left.“This is the old Spanish inquisition room,”"
7,a,"with age. They finally hired a carramata, the native cab, and drove through the city and out on the military road, begun by the Spaniards years before but, as was the custom of the country, never finished. As they drove into the Plaza on their return they came face to face with Señor Espinosa, riding a blooded horse which was prancing and pawing the earth, and making vain attempts to unseat its rider. Espinosa drew rein and bowed pointedly and courteously to the Americans.“Señores,” he called eagerly, “may I have a word with you?”Phil ordered his cochero to stop, while Espinosa dismounted, throwing his reins to a[99] small native gamin near by. The native advanced to the carriage hat in hand and with as much ceremony as if he were about to speak to some exalted personage.“I am extremely mortified at my actions of yesterday,” he exclaimed in his fluent"
8,a,"loud voice in the Visayan tongue from the building they had just left was answered by many excited voices in the gathered crowd, and then several women advanced slowly, holding up their hands in sign of peace, their bodies close together as if for mutual protection. The lads scarcely noticed the approach of the women, so occupied were they in watching the building in which were imprisoned five of the traitors who had been biting the hand of the master that fed them. A swift glance over his shoulder showed Phil[186] that the advancing women were scarce ten paces away from Sydney, who was guarding one corner of the house, while he was some thirty feet away, guarding the other three sides. The soldiers were not over a block away and hastening toward him; he could hear the rattle of their gun slings, and the thud of their heavy shoes"
9,a,"about quickly and gaze into the amused but wicked eyes of Colonel Salas. “So we are to have the pleasure of your company as our guest, after all?” the Filipino continued tauntingly. “General Espinosa is making great preparations for your reception. It is needless for me to tell you how delighted he is that you have changed your mind. He was very angry at me for not insisting on your coming with me the other day.”Phil regarded the little native, a fine scorn in his eyes. He would have liked nothing better than to have answered him in the same ironical vein, but he realized that to do so and anger him would only make more difficult their position.“He will be here to pay his respects shortly,”[312] Salas continued ironically. “Ah! here he comes now.”With his heart beating fast and the muscles in his throat tightening, Phil saw Espinosa sauntering"
10,a,"prisoners to Espinosa’s camp.”[279]The girl gave a low exclamation of surprised horror, regarding Phil fixedly, half believing the lad was out of his mind.“I mean it,” he exclaimed earnestly. “It’s the only chance we have of saving Tillotson’s life. Your men must pretend to have deserted after the death of their master,” he dropped his voice as he saw the look of pain in Maria’s eyes at the mention of her father’s sad fate. “Lopez will claim to have taken us prisoners and then deserted to the insurgents. It’s a good plan,” he cried enthusiastically, “and is sure to be successful.”Maria paled at the mere thought of such rashness, but seeing Phil could not be moved from his avowed intention, she gave her consent grudgingly.The general was not so easily convinced. His natural and inherent cautiousness could not be changed even under the combined persuasion of the midshipman and his"
11,a,"visitor pass out through the wide entrance, he turned and called for his servant.“Tell the messenger I will speak to him,” he said as the muchacho noiselessly entered.A moment later a ragged native stood tremblingly before him, twisting his dirty head-covering in his nervous hands.Espinosa seated himself luxuriously in the chair recently vacated by Captain Blynn. He had now regained his old confidence and cruel arrogance, while he fired question after question at the uncomfortable native.The Presidente sat motionless in his chair long after his messenger had gone. His servant came noiselessly into the room several times but tiptoed away, believing his master was asleep. But Espinosa was far from sleep, his brain was actively at work. How could he hold his position and yet remain undiscovered to this terrible Captain Blynn? He shuddered as he remembered those big hands as they worked longingly to grasp his slender neck. He"
12,a,"march toward the stronghold. If he is captured or killed in the battle I shall seek General Wilson and surrender myself and men. If Espinosa escapes I shall follow him to the death.”[360]Maria knew the native spirit too well to attempt to urge her brother to give up this perilous quest of their father’s murderer, so she bowed her head submissively.An hour saw the band on the march, with Maria and Juan mounted on two ponies; quietly the native soldiers led by Gregorio Rodriguez circled the Americans encamped at the ranch and struck the trail taken in the morning by Captain Blynn and his five hundred soldiers.Long before they came in sight of the stronghold the distant rumble of musketry and the thunder of artillery told them of the struggle at the top of the mountain.Despairing of reaching the battle-field by the treacherous trail already covered by the Americans, Gregorio"
13,a,"he straightened his slight frame and rode boldly, with head erect, beside the American leader.One hour before sunrise Captain Blynn disposed his command in a single circular line about the base of a high hill; its sides[76] were covered with a dense jungle while a single trail led to the top.Under the guardianship of Espinosa the command moved forward, straight up through the high clutching brush; the men were so close to each other that their neighbors on each side were always in sight. Captain Blynn and one company marched fearlessly up the trail. A few feet from where the round top hill had been cleared he halted and waited for the remainder of his men to join him. His enemy’s camp was silent, but his keen eyes could discern shadowy forms lying prone on the ground. He searched for a sentry, but no movement could be seen. Were they"
14,a,"given prompt attention by the surgeon and several ugly wounds were carefully dressed. Phil was glad to relinquish his command to Sydney and remained luxuriously in his cot.At Rodriguez’s ranch the gunboat stopped and reverently landed the dead heroes, to be buried in the cemetery, and here General Wilson and his adjutant-general disembarked to return to Palilo by road.Just as the “Mindinao” started ahead, after landing her passengers, on its way to the mouth of the river, a native canoe paddled rapidly from the landing, and ran up alongside of the gunboat. An excited hail came from its occupant, answered by an angry cry from Major Lukban who turned, his face deathly pale, and his hands trembling, to the midshipmen at his side.“Señorita Maria is missing,” he gasped.The midshipmen were stunned at the suddenness of this unexpected and disquieting news. Maria captured! What did it mean?Lukban declared that his first"
15,a,"of the crew of the ‘Albany’ they would have all been shot or swung at her yard-arm. Seizing this merchant ship and killing her captain is piracy.”“I think O’Neil is right,” Sydney exclaimed patting the sailor on the back enthusiastically.[59] “The girl’s all right—I’ll take my hat off to her every time.”“It was my own stupidity, I suppose,” Phil declared, his face sobering slightly. “I thought she was too frightened to know what was happening; in fact I really didn’t believe she would understand what I intended doing.”“Who do you suppose she is?” Sydney asked eagerly. “Isn’t it queer she has never told us her name?”“It probably wouldn’t aid us if she had,” Phil replied; “she’s probably the daughter of some rich Filipino, who holds a fat position under our civil government. By the way she talked when we first met her I thought she was dead against war, yet"
16,a,"careful, Syd,” he added anxiously. “We’ve got to fight our way out. There seems no other way. There are twenty of them against us two.”At the top of the steps Salas turned and looked questioningly at the midshipmen. Phil dared not meet his eye for fear that the little native would see the anxiety which he strove to hide.On the floor of the big room a cloth had been spread and a repast set out.With a graceful wave of his thin hands[214] Colonel Salas made a sign for all to be seated and took, himself, the place beside Maria. Phil sat on the other side of Maria, while Sydney and little Juan were placed opposite.Their brisk ride had given them all an appetite, but the terrible predicament in which they now found themselves had quite taken away their relish for food. The lads did their best to appear undisturbed, but"
17,a,"Then a trembling seized him as a great black fin protruded from the water and the sun’s rays reflected deep red against the green of the reef.“Sharks,” he cried hoarsely, balancing himself with a great effort, for he had been about to plunge overboard to rescue his enemy.O’Neil as if by intuition had seized the lad by the foot and forcibly hauled him back into the boat.The two boats were soon secured together and the Americans, putting aside their weapons of destruction, looked down pityingly upon the terrified natives huddled together in the bottom of the proa. Many were wounded by the Krag bullets and several had died not knowing pain, so swiftly had death come. Far astern a black curl of smoke marked the gunboat.All hands turned to willingly and administered to the stricken enemy and soon all the wounded were made as comfortable as possible, their bleeding stanched,"
18,a,"characteristically jerking his thumb toward the islands astern fast being swallowed up in the glassy sea. “They ain’t taking no chances. That stretch of shore yonder,” he added, his gaze on the shore line ahead, “must be the mouth of the Davao River.”The lads gazed eagerly at the faint curl of smoke astern, but it gave them but scant encouragement, for it was only too evident that before the stranger, if it were one of the many small gunboats patrolling the islands, could hope to get within gunshot of the “Negros,” the steamer would have crossed the shallow bar of the Davao River and be safe from the pursuit of the deeper vessel.“If we could only stop her,” Phil lamented. “Smash those rickety engines or haul fires in the boiler.”O’Neil in answer cast a comprehensive glance at the sentries on guard on the upper deck. The evil-looking natives were squatted"
19,a,"not a coward; he’s just overcautious and a bit of a braggart. He didn’t like attacking in the dark.”The four boats pulled with oars muffled in toward the dim shore. Phil steered his boat for a point behind the long fringe of flashes, where the insurgent firing line was established, creeping ever closer to the handful entrenched behind walls that would soon be too hot to hold them. He had abandoned his first plan and now was landing all of his mixed command to the left of the town. If he could land without discovery, the first the enemy would know of his presence would be the horrifying, crackling report of the machine gun.“There, steer for that,” Phil breathed as a mound-like hill took shape out of the darkness.With eyes straining and faculties alert for the first premonition of danger, Phil directed his boat forward. The gunboat had been swallowed"
20,a,"side of the small hut, to put himself out of reach of the startled prisoner.“Who are you?” came from the figure, in a weak voice. “Yes, I am Lieutenant Tillotson. Tell me I’m not dreaming. Didn’t I hear a white man’s voice?”[289]Phil could see him dimly by the light of the camp-fire outside. The man had been completely cowed. What terrible torture had been inflicted to cause him to become such an abject figure, groveling before them, his voice hollow, and in his eyes a light of unreasonable fear?“It is Midshipman Perry and O’Neil from the gunboat, Tillotson,” the lad whispered. “We hope to save you if you will keep quiet and do just what we tell you.” Phil could have wept in pity at the sight of the physical wreck before him. He was shocked at the sight. Tillotson’s eyes were dull and the face empty of hope.“You don’t"
21,a,"to the tall mountains ahead of them.“Time and again the Spaniards have endeavored to drive out the outlaws from yonder stronghold, and the poor people who made their living on the river were mercilessly preyed upon by the war parties of the contending factions, until none were left. Juan Rodriguez alone has managed to remain, but only by his fearless courage and the devotion of his followers. Neither side cared to provoke him in his security until Espinosa coveted his lands and his money and, who can say, maybe his beautiful daughter.”“Maria!” Sydney exclaimed.The native lowered his voice to a whisper.“Espinosa has had but one ambition all his life; to marry the daughter of Rodriguez; but she scorned him, and to save her from his persistent attention, Señorita Maria was sent away to Manila to school. Now he has robbed her of her father and stolen the treasure which had"
22,a,"with the courage of despair;[309] and the American soldiers, fearlessly charging upward, giving no heed to the danger at the top. On the summit, the lad knew, it would be a fight to the death. The part he was to play had seemed only too simple in the light of day, but now in the silence of the night, bound as he was hand and foot, and guarded by cruel enemies who would gladly shoot him down at the first show of force, all seemed different. O’Neil’s healthy body had long since been wrapped in slumber and when Phil’s feverish eyes opened he was up and seated calmly by the lad’s side.“There are over a thousand of these gugus here in the camp,” he exclaimed as Phil with difficulty arose and endeavored to stretch his cramped limbs. “I have been spying from the door there, and I see Lopez has"
23,a,"and again the slight sound trembled on the still night. Like statues silhouetted[240] against the sky, for a second or more the three men sat transfixed with apprehension. Then as one man they whirled their horses about and galloped madly back over the road in the direction from which they had come. That far-distant sound could have but one interpretation;—the Rodriguez ranch was being attacked, and they might be needed.After the midshipmen had ridden away Maria returned to the large living-room to bid her father good-night. A new pleasure had come into her life, and what was more natural than that she should wish to share it with him? These frank, young Americans had proved themselves to be of a quality which she had not thought existed outside of the story-books of her childhood. She believed that in their friendship her father’s difficulties would melt away. Juan Rodriguez, interested as"
24,a,"seemed more in place in a drawing-room than in the jungles of the Philippines.“I saw the gunboat when we struck the beach below there,” Captain Baker exclaimed, his anxiety relieved after Tillotson had assured him all was safe, and he advanced hand outstretched, a hearty smile of greeting on his strong face. “Is this the new captain[134] of the ‘Mindinao’? I am glad to meet you both,” he said as he shook the hands of the midshipmen in turn. “I suppose we are once more indebted to the navy.”Tillotson frowned. “I have fifty men with me,” he exclaimed protestingly. “Of course the gunboat was useful in bringing us here and shelling the beach.”“What’s become of all the town natives?” Captain Baker asked suddenly.“They all left town yesterday morning,” the sergeant replied. “That’s how we knew that all was not going just right.”“The cowardly beggars!” Captain Baker exclaimed. “You’d have thought"
25,a,"in smothered rage, and Phil saw with astonishment that O’Neil had naught but his bare hands though the lust of battle was in his eyes. The horror of his recent torture pressed heavily on his mind and he was bending every exertion to reach the retreating insurgent leader.So closely did the Americans press their foes that the lifeless body of Lieutenant Tillotson was abandoned, and Phil stopped, kneeling at his side and gazed down into the still[334] face. There was a deep wound in the neck. Phil saw that the troubled spirit had been released. Ahead the pursuers had stopped and were firing fiercely in the direction of the retreating enemy.“We can’t allow Espinosa to escape,” the lad cried, aghast as he regained his men and saw with horror that many lay moaning on the ground.“They’re intrenched there, sir,” a sergeant exclaimed. “It would be suicide to charge them;” but"
26,a,"My people in war are not men, señor, they are demons.”While the girl was talking the steamer had drawn closer to the lorcha which Phil had sighted earlier in the afternoon. The night was not bright; a crescent moon cast a dim light on the hull scarcely a hundred yards on the weather bow. The breeze had freshened, and with wind free the lorcha’s sails bellied[21] out, giving it a speed almost equal to that of the steamer.“Why doesn’t he give that sail a wider berth?” Phil exclaimed suddenly as the girl’s voice died away. “If she should yaw now, she’d be into us.”“Look out!” Sydney cried in alarm as the lorcha suddenly sheered to leeward and the great mass of tautening canvas careened toward the unsuspecting steamer.The midshipmen were on their feet in an instant, while O’Neil came running up from the deck below.The Spanish captain, calling loudly to"
27,a,"him carefully and to allow no interference by their native allies.By nine o’clock two hundred men had been embarked on the gunboat and five hundred more had started under the command of Captain Blynn along the trail leading up the river; Garcia as leader was at their head.In the party on the gunboat were General Wilson, Major Marble and Major Lukban; the latter, still sullen and angry with Sydney for his unwarranted presumption in making him[298] discontinue his torture, stood with his former victim on the bridge of the “Mindinao.”Sydney headed the vessel into the narrow channel, cautiously picking his way through the numerous shoals; one minute the gunboat clung closely to the steep river bank on one side and the next it was scraping the overhanging trees on the other side.From the masthead the lookout kept the soldiers on shore in sight, and Sydney regulated his speed to just"
28,a,"torturing sensations of a drowning man; not once but many times, until his spirit was broken and he would answer questions which would make him traitorously injure his own cause. His eyes opened, and he saw dimly Espinosa’s mocking face above him. The sun had flamed forth from under a cloud and burned down unmercifully on his staring eyes. He noted vaguely that it had passed the meridian. Then a terrible fear came into his mind. Where were the gunboat and the soldiers? Surely by this time they would have made their presence known. Had the gunboat run aground and the expedition been delayed? Would a delay mean death to him and O’Neil or only one more awful day of diabolical torture?“If you will cease torturing my man,” Phil said with difficulty through his wedged jaws, “I will answer your questions.”[321]Espinosa laughed cruelly.“So you would dictate your own terms,” he"
29,a,"are lined up against the wall at Cavite and shot for piracy.”Phil held up his hand to demand silence from the excited sailor. He did not know how much English the girl might know, and the ladrone leader might learn the dire wish of the sailorman for him and his followers. Then if the “Negros” escaped, his anger could[36] be vented upon the Americans. But the girl’s face did not betray that she had understood the meaning of O’Neil’s words. The “Albany” was fast approaching, but Phil knew that O’Neil must be overestimating the cruiser’s speed; the most she could make, without special preparation, would be fifteen knots, but, and his joy welled up into his eyes,—her six-inch guns! He had seen them fired with accuracy at four miles.The shore line ahead had now become distinct. The deep cut in the surrounding hills betrayed the presence of the Davao River"
30,a,"them long in suspense, and had his say with his usual directness.“Lieutenant Tillotson, the officer of the guard yesterday, is missing. His bed shows that he did not sleep in it at all last night. I have investigated the case as far as I have been able, and I find that no one passed through the sentries except a closed carriage and a squad of Filipinos. This sentry says that you and Mr. Monroe vouched for them. Tillotson was last seen an hour before this[168] time by a sentry at the bridge whom he visited. As soon as I heard of the carriage episode I cautioned the sentry to say nothing. I wanted to see you and clear up that part before I investigated further.”Phil sat speechless in his seat while the judge-advocate general talked on earnestly. Tillotson had disappeared! How could he have been forcibly carried past the numerous"
31,a,"earnestness of his face that this gruesome information was being given for the Americans’ own good.“Your friends,” the colonel continued, “will doubtless attempt a rescue, and that will only add to your danger.”After Colonel Martinez had said good-night Phil told his companions of the unpleasant and disquieting reports concerning their future captor, but nothing could shake O’Neil’s good spirits.“It’s all in the game, Mr. Perry,” he said philosophically. “They can’t do more than kill us, and as we’ve got to die some day, it might just as well be in Kapay as any other place. But as long as we’ve got our senses and our strong arms, there are going to be some little brown men hurt before I give up my mess number.“What I’ve been trying to study out,” the sailor continued, seeing the two lads still silent, “is how all those American soldiers could pass along that trail"
32,a,"paddling out in their canoes to capture a steel monitor, it’s too absurd. Yet we stood watch on and watch off every night waiting for ’em to board. Do you blame me, sir, for feeling happy when I got these orders?” tapping his telegram against an awning stanchion. “This means life again; like we had in the dago country and up with them pigtailed chinks.”The midshipmen slapped the loquacious sailor joyfully on the back.[14]“You’re not half as glad to be with us as we are to have you,” Phil exclaimed frankly. “We’re just aching for something worth while—we’ve been roasting up on the Yangtse River since you left us, doing nothing except watch the grass burn up and the water in the river fall. I never felt such heat.”While the Americans were talking the little steamer slipped noisily down the busy river and out on the bay made famous by"
33,a,"above him poured the liquid without ceasing into his wide open mouth. The water splashed and ran out. He managed yet to breathe by contracting the muscles of his throat and then taking a slow breath but even then he felt the irritation of a few drops of water in his lungs and he knew if he coughed, as he must in a second, that all the water in his throat and mouth would enter his windpipe and fairly choke him. A feeling of suffocation oppressed him, as if a heavy weight lay pressing on his chest. He knew as yet he had not suffered, that this was but a taste of what was to come. Once more, this time as if from a great distance, he heard the cold, sinister voice of the half-breed.[322]“Before it is too late,” he said, “will you answer my questions?”Phil opened his eyes and"
34,a,"they cut his binding cords and gave both him and O’Neil a bucket of water to wash in. They had been on the point of arousing Tillotson by a cruel kick, but through Phil’s insistence, they left the shack without disturbing the sleeping man.After eating and enjoying a scanty breakfast, the two Americans surveyed with great interest the scenes about them.[311]“Do you see that gun there, sir?” O’Neil exclaimed, suddenly nodding his head toward a Spanish howitzer mounted on the cliff just to the right of the trail. “It’s manned by Espinosa’s men!”“That’s bad,” Phil replied anxiously; “and you notice, it commands the river.”“Good-morning,” in Spanish from behind them caused Phil to swing about quickly and gaze into the amused but wicked eyes of Colonel Salas. “So we are to have the pleasure of your company as our guest, after all?” the Filipino continued tauntingly. “General Espinosa is making great"
35,a,"navy for saving my men. Tillotson, you can return; I’ll keep your men.”Lieutenant Tillotson’s face, which had become sorely troubled as the telegram had been read, suddenly cleared. Phil felt that he would have died if a soldier of Captain Baker’s standing and reputation had even hinted at his uselessness, as he had at this hard-skinned, self-satisfied lieutenant.After a night’s run the “Mindinao” was[136] again tied up to the dock at Palilo. On the trip down the lads had left their unpleasant passenger severely alone, while he had spent his evening writing, filling sheet after sheet of paper with closely spaced lines.“Official report of a spectator,” Sydney whispered loud enough purposely for Tillotson to hear. The latter looked up and scowled.After breakfast the next morning Phil reported at the general’s office. Major Marble received him with a grave face.“For the land’s sake, Perry! What have you done to Tillotson? He"
36,a,"would still hold. They were true in substance,[139] every one of them. As commanding officer of a gunboat Phil was within his rights when he laid his plans as to where the attack of the gunboat should be and the locality to land his own men; but he could only advise the army man from his nautical experience as to where the best place would be to land the soldiers in order that their coöperation might be harmonious. Lieutenant Tillotson was free to accept his suggestions or refuse them as he saw fit. So long as they were both afloat the army officer could give no orders to him, nor could Phil give orders to his superior in rank. To the anxious lad it was certainly a perplexing situation. His conscience was quite clear upon the soundness of the plan he had proposed, and he felt that in carrying it"
37,a,"the army man.“I suppose,” Phil said in apology for him as they parted, one to turn in, the other to keep watch until midnight, “that he’s had so much fighting he’s grown careless.”At midnight Phil was awakened, and relieved Sydney on the bridge, while the latter went below to get a few hours’ sleep before he would be needed in the work to be accomplished. Phil gazed through the darkness[108] ahead of the gunboat; the dim outline of the land along which they were traveling could be seen on the port hand. The coast was bald and he knew he could without danger run as close as he desired to its precipitous cliffs. The more he thought of the scornful carelessness of the young lieutenant the angrier he became. What right had he to consider such an expedition one to require no plans? What if he landed in an ambush?“He"
38,a,"which Phil had taken from the dead messenger at Binalbagan. The message was in Espinosa’s own handwriting, and warned the attackers of the gunboat’s approach.“I see now that I have been repaid for my stupidity,” he moaned. “I believed that I could unmask him and earn the thanks of the general, but first I wished to get from him a full confession and implicate his accomplices. I showed him the letter and told him I would call at his house after visiting the sentries.” The overwrought officer broke down and sobbed for several minutes before continuing.[291] “I was a child in his hands; I did not know his power. His followers trapped me and carried me away by water, bringing me to this awful place. Every day some new torture is devised for me. To-day I was suspended by my neck with only my toes on the ground. That was"
39,a,"of coast line. An occasional sail was sighted and overhauled, only to find in it a handful of frightened fishermen.[353]As night approached the gunboat was brought to a stop in the centre of the line of patrol in order that it might be at an equal distance from all possible points of departure, in case Espinosa had eluded his pursuers.“If he has a proa in waiting, hidden in the swamps of one of these estuaries, he will choose night for his escape,” Phil declared as he studied his inaccurate chart, “and at night he can easily elude us, for it is too dark to see a half mile. Our only hope is that there will be no wind, and if the air is sufficiently calm we can hear the dip of oars for miles.”Phil stationed his sailors as lookouts everywhere, with orders to listen alertly and make known to him"
40,a,"grounded on the sandy beach and the men had jumped overboard into the shallow water. Once on the beach, he superintended the securing of the boats and then led the way toward the point he had selected for the first position to be occupied. The enemy were only a few hundred yards away, but so intent were they on the accomplishment[118] of their cruel purposes, that the shadowy forms of the men from the sea, stealing quietly through the short grass and against a background of darkness, were not discovered.Phil’s quick eyes suddenly discovered some one approaching from a direction away from the enemy. He gripped his revolver firmly, not knowing how many more men might be behind the figure discovered. As the Americans approached the newcomer, a native suddenly raised his hand and called loudly:“Amigo, hua carta.”[2]A blow from O’Neil’s revolver butt was the answer, while Phil grasped the"
41,a,"asked eagerly. “I have a plan, and all depends upon whether he can be trusted to lead us against Espinosa, if not willingly, then under intimidation.”“Before they killed my father and carried away the treasure,” the girl answered, a spark of excitement entering her dull eyes, “Espinosa and Salas got the information necessary for their work from Garcia, bound and helpless where your sailors had left him. They refused to liberate him and hoped he would be killed by the Americans. You can be sure,” she added, “that he will take keen pleasure in running his enemies to earth.”“And now for my favor from you,” the lad continued in a lower tone; “as Garcia will take Lopez’s place as guide for the soldiers to the trail up the mountain, I want twenty-five of your men whom you would trust to the death, under the command of Lopez, to take O’Neil"
42,a,"the girl dismissed the guards and the Americans once more gathered about the breakfast table.A few moments later Colonel Martinez, his face wreathed in smiles, left the bridge and joined them.[57]“You are to be given the freedom of the town,” he said as he took a cup of coffee from the servant’s hands and sipped it gratefully, “but I warn you if you attempt to escape you will be shot, and even if you escaped, without guides you would be lost in the jungle and be killed by ladrones.”Phil bowed his head in sign of submission. They were certainly prisoners, without hope of rescue.“To-morrow morning,” Colonel Martinez added, “we shall leave the village and march inland. I have already sent to notify our leader that I have successfully arrived. I think for your own good it would be wiser for you to remain on board here until we start. I"
43,a,"What have you done to Tillotson? He denounces you in scathing terms in his official report to the general; accuses you of weakening his authority before his men; humiliating him on your own ship; deliberately shoving off from the ship without him because he did not approve of the entire plan which you devised without his concurrence, and lastly reports you for insubordination when under his orders ashore and treating your superior officer with contempt. In fact,” Major Marble ended, “he has started at the top and gone to the bottom of all the military offenses.”[137]Phil gasped in astonishment. Major Marble stood gazing compassionately at his young friend, apparently hoping to hear him clear up the mystery. But Phil was silent. He must have time to think.After Phil had reached his ship he scarcely remembered how he had behaved to his anxious and sympathetic friend, Major Marble. The boy’s mind"
44,a,"or else let’s try to get by; we can’t afford to[337] leave the neck of the sack open for Espinosa and his cutthroats to escape.”Sydney saw there was no way out of the situation, save to silence the battery:—one shot through the boiler of the “Mindinao,” and the gunboat with all on board would be killed by the explosion or else drowned in the madly racing current of the river.“Take a few shots at that gun,” he ordered hoarsely. The gun-pointers when they heard the spiteful hiss of the enemy’s shell had, as though by an order, ceased their fire and waited obediently for the command which they felt sure the midshipman would give. They did not relish being fired upon and not allowed to return the fire.Sydney’s glasses were upon the cliff: he saw a group of struggling figures about the cannon, and then to his surprise and joy"
45,a,"had been embarked on the gunboat and five hundred more had started under the command of Captain Blynn along the trail leading up the river; Garcia as leader was at their head.In the party on the gunboat were General Wilson, Major Marble and Major Lukban; the latter, still sullen and angry with Sydney for his unwarranted presumption in making him[298] discontinue his torture, stood with his former victim on the bridge of the “Mindinao.”Sydney headed the vessel into the narrow channel, cautiously picking his way through the numerous shoals; one minute the gunboat clung closely to the steep river bank on one side and the next it was scraping the overhanging trees on the other side.From the masthead the lookout kept the soldiers on shore in sight, and Sydney regulated his speed to just keep pace with them. He thought often and with grave concern of Phil. What luck had"
46,a,"wish to occupy the position just vacated by our mutual friend Espinosa?”Rodriguez drew himself up proudly while the midshipmen gasped at this harsh arraignment.“I do not blame you, señor,” the native answered, no evidence of anger on his placid face. “I know that you can have but little reason to trust the honesty of the men of my race. But I do not desire a position. I am now ready to take the field with my men, heretofore neutral. I have three hundred rifles.”“You are ready then to take the oath of allegiance?” Captain Blynn asked in official tones.“Yes, señor, and keep it,” Rodriguez returned, his eyes unflinching.“Have you any news that will lead to our knowing the whereabouts of Lieutenant Tillotson?” Blynn asked.“Ah, I have,” the native answered eagerly.[194] “I was about to ask you—my spies report a captive with Espinosa.”The Americans gave sighs of relief. At least Tillotson"
47,a,"he looked about him he saw that Colonel Martinez had gone; from the gloom of the jungle he heard the rustle of brush and caught a glimpse of misty forms. He[80] raised his rifle half-way and then lowered it. In his heart he rejoiced that he had not taken him prisoner.In the next second Espinosa leaped toward him. Phil was stunned by a stinging blow; but before it could be repeated O’Neil interposed and Espinosa had measured his length on the ground.“Where did Colonel Martinez go?” Phil asked quietly.“I didn’t see,” O’Neil answered, his face as solemn as that of a judge.Phil smiled and put out his hand. The two men exchanged clasps. “I believe he would have done as much for us,” Phil said.Before the sun had risen above the sea to the eastward, the fight was over. But few of the enemy had escaped. Asking no quarter, fighting"
48,a,"hurling rocks into the river below them, and he cut a lane toward them, yelling to the loyal natives to prevent what he feared would be the destruction of his ship. From below the ominous rattle of a Colt gun gladdened his heart and he saw[332] with delight the men on the cliffs flee in terror, leaving great boulders balanced menacingly on the very edge of the abyss. An American cheer rang out from behind him and he became dizzy with joy at the good news it brought. He read in the natives’ eyes a look of terror at the sudden appearance of an unlooked for enemy, and at the same instant he realized that if he and his loyal natives were to be saved he must extricate them from this dangerous position between the fire of the two opposing forces. He looked wildly about him for Lopez, but he"
49,a,"you can’t show me how these men were butchered, I’ll fill you up to the neck with it.”Espinosa wetted his lips with his tongue and swallowed hard, but the captain by taking the proffered chair had removed the native from the terrifying influence of those powerful twitching fingers which he had seen ready to throttle him, and he, in proportion to the distance away of the cause of his fear, grew bolder.“The señor capitan must know of my sincerity,” he pleaded in a weak voice.[49] “Have I not taken the oath of allegiance to the United States? Do I not know the punishment for breaking that oath?”Captain Blynn nodded his head. “Go ahead,” he commanded impatiently; “cut that out, give me the unvarnished story.”“The information which I gave you and which was sworn to by three witnesses came from Juan Rodriguez,” Espinosa continued, dropping his voice to a whisper and"
50,a,"her hands placed lightly on Phil’s shoulder she jumped down to the deck and advanced to meet the native leader. At a few paces from her he halted, and the Americans held their breath in wonder to see the bandit bow low before her, raising her hand to his lips. Then he turned and gave several harsh commands to his followers, who quietly dispersed.Inside of but a few minutes the lorcha had disappeared in the night and the “Negros” resumed its journey, the noisy engines chugging away just as faithfully under their new masters.[28]The Americans, as they gathered about the table to finish the meal long forgotten in the excitement of the attack, marveled at the outcome of the affair.“Who can she be?” Sydney whispered. “Why, she orders the ladrone leader around as if she were a princess.”Phil was about to reply when the girl herself appeared from the shadows,"
51,a,"bamboo spears bared their sharp, venomous points. The lad shuddered as he realized the murderous trick which had failed. If they had fallen with the floor, heavily weighted as it was with stones at the side, and resting on supports, which had been dislodged by a rope in the hands of one of the villains now hanging on the wall of the room, they would at this moment be lying pierced through and perhaps dying before the eyes of their cruel enemy.He raised his revolver and covered the nearest cringing native, a terrible anger in his eyes. In another second he would have pulled the trigger, but Sydney’s hand closed firmly over his wrist, forcing his revolver upward and the ball sped harmlessly over the terrified native’s head.“They are more valuable alive,” Sydney[185] exclaimed to Phil’s angry cry of protest. “Come, let’s get outside before more of this hinged floor"
52,a,"the bamboo town nestling in the hollow of two small hills in the midst of the swampy mouth of the Mani River. As they approached, the Americans could discover naught but the usual listless life of a Filipino village.“I’ll patrol here,” Phil said, as he steered further offshore.All day long the gunboat steamed backward and forward over fifteen miles of coast line. An occasional sail was sighted and overhauled, only to find in it a handful of frightened fishermen.[353]As night approached the gunboat was brought to a stop in the centre of the line of patrol in order that it might be at an equal distance from all possible points of departure, in case Espinosa had eluded his pursuers.“If he has a proa in waiting, hidden in the swamps of one of these estuaries, he will choose night for his escape,” Phil declared as he studied his inaccurate chart, “and"
53,a,"banks outside of the Philippines to live in ease and luxury for the remainder of my life.“These thoughts,” he added, “may cheer your last hours. It should be a pleasure to you to know that you haven’t done me as much harm as you supposed.”Phil glared at his tormentor, a bitter hatred in his eyes. How cleverly had this half-breed played upon the credulity of the Americans! For months this despicable native had ruled over both the warring parties; on one hand controlling the native bands of insurgents, telling them how, when and where to attack their enemy and then by his plausible words and treacherous cunning had exerted sufficient influence over General Wilson and his aides to enable him to so dispose the scattered[315] American troops as to make them impotent, helpless against the insurgent ambushes and attacks. The lad noticed with a certain satisfaction that the native wore"
54,a,"in Kapay.”Phil blushed furiously, and his eyes flared forth his indignation at such an unfair remark. Especially as he could make no answer to an officer of such rank.The general adjusted his glasses and read from beginning to end the report placed on his desk by the captain; then he glanced up, a puzzled look on his deeply lined face.“This is a very ugly business,” he said sharply. “We have no time to investigate such matters. We are busy putting down this rebellion. Yet such conduct as charged in this report, Mr. Perry, cannot go unheeded. There’s but one thing to do,” he continued after a moment’s thought. “Wire to the admiral at Manila and request your detachment for private reasons.”“That would be a tacit acknowledgment that I am in the wrong,” Phil cried out, his voice trembling with anger at the injustice in the general’s words.“Read this letter,” the"
55,a,"you are attacked, retreat and fall back on the main body.”Lieutenant Simpson picked his men quickly and disappeared quietly down the trail. Captain Blynn watched them until swallowed up in the darkness, and then set the long line in motion again. Every soldier took, instinctively, a tighter grip upon his musket, and loosened the sharp sword bayonet from its scabbard. Each knew that when “Black Jack” Blynn took precautions there was reason to scent trouble.Half-way through the defile a guarded whistle of warning came to Blynn’s ears from the point. As one man the long column halted; the soldiers’ heavy breathing was distinctly audible above the tremor of the metallic[74] rattling of accoutrements. Each soldier sought his neighbor’s face for a key to the solution of the problem. Blynn, motioning Espinosa to follow, rode silently forward. In the trail a hundred paces ahead he saw Lieutenant Simpson bending over a"
56,a,"that a small body of men had recently landed at this very spot and had taken the almost obliterated trail to the abandoned house. Maria and her brother might even now be prisoners among their enemy. The two midshipmen gazed at each other through eyes wide with apprehension. What was to be done?“We can’t desert the girl,” Sydney declared, gazing at the trodden grass. “Otherwise we might reach the horses and escape before they discover us.”“Come,” Phil exclaimed, “there are not many of them, and maybe,” he added reassuringly, “they are not all armed.”The two lads walked noiselessly toward the house along the dim trail.The building was now in plain sight. The[206] wide porch with its profusion of clinging vines was deserted. The long flight of bamboo steps was half in ruins. To the right not a hundred yards distant their horses were standing, their noses deep in the rich"
57,a,"seen him stand bravely before a score of his countrymen, who he knew would like nothing better than to murder him, and tell them boldly that he was for the right even if to be so would cause him to be called a traitor! Now he had declared for the American cause and almost every influential native’s hand was against him.Maria went with them to where the grooms held their horses.“Señorita, we can never thank you enough,” Phil declared gladly. “You are forever putting us in your debt.”“Ah, you have forgotten the night you saved Colonel Martinez,” she said softly, and Phil imagined in the moonlight that her eyes shone brighter.“By Jove, Phil!” Sydney exclaimed eagerly a moment later, after they and Lopez had swung themselves into their saddles and were trotting down the broad roadway, “I didn’t believe it was in any girl to have such grit, least of"
58,a,"heads with some force against his back and cried out with surprise.“Why, sir!” he answered in an aggrieved tone. “Have I done anything to displease you, sir?”Phil laughed outright, only to be prodded by the sharp bayonets of his captors for his incautiousness.“If that’s the way you feel about it,” he said, “I am glad you are here.”Inside of ten minutes, conversation was[288] impossible, for they needed all their breath for the precipitous climb up the face of the cliff leading to the top of the mountain. The natives on each side of the prisoners pulled and pushed them up the jagged and rocky trail until their bodies were bruised and their skin torn in many places by the cruel cactus and “Spanish bayonet,” which seemed to have been planted by nature as a further difficulty for those who dared to ascend the secret trail to the insurgent stronghold.After many"
59,a,"carramata, the native cab, and drove through the city and out on the military road, begun by the Spaniards years before but, as was the custom of the country, never finished. As they drove into the Plaza on their return they came face to face with Señor Espinosa, riding a blooded horse which was prancing and pawing the earth, and making vain attempts to unseat its rider. Espinosa drew rein and bowed pointedly and courteously to the Americans.“Señores,” he called eagerly, “may I have a word with you?”Phil ordered his cochero to stop, while Espinosa dismounted, throwing his reins to a[99] small native gamin near by. The native advanced to the carriage hat in hand and with as much ceremony as if he were about to speak to some exalted personage.“I am extremely mortified at my actions of yesterday,” he exclaimed in his fluent and grandiloquent Spanish. “I have just"
60,a,"added in Spanish, casting a quick glance toward the squad of soldiers. “Poor fellows, it would be a pity to kill them, for they are but acting under orders.”The lads were too grateful to their rescuer for saving their lives to make useless inquiries as to why his influence could be exerted over the acts of their enemy. Phil’s first thought was for the men whom the captain had left them to guard.[190]“Surround this house,” he commanded, and the sergeant in charge gave a short command and led the way himself to the rear of the large native building.“It is too late, señor commandante,” Rodriguez said shaking his head; “they have all escaped through the rear door and are by now safely away.”The midshipmen ran quickly up the steps and gazed disappointedly into the gloom beyond. The floor still lay at the bottom of the cellar, the bamboo spears sticking"
61,a,"gangway,” Phil reiterated, his voice showing perfect control of temper. The lad glanced forward meaningly to where many of the crew had collected, intently listening to the heated colloquy between their young captain and this big, blustering army officer.Then a voice from the dock made both the combatants turn suddenly and gaze in surprise at the general, who, unobserved, had stopped abreast them and had been an amused spectator of the discomfiture of his judge-advocate.“I’ll tear up that telegram as soon as I get to the office,” he exclaimed chuckling gleefully; “and, Blynn, you’d better come ashore here before Captain Perry pitches you over the gangway.”Captain Blynn had but one great fault and that was his inability to consider that anything mattered outside of his beloved work. Ruthlessly he would trample over those in the way of success. Once he was on the trail of a wrong-doer, he would follow"
62,a,"the insults offered him by the army man. Sydney’s eyes blazed in anger.“The dastardly coward,” he exclaimed after the story had been unfurled before him. “While you were risking your life, he was sitting on the quarter-deck apparently glad to be in a place of safety, and now he comes and wants to reap all the reward. I don’t see how he has the face to appear before his men.”“He’s not a regular, anyway,” Phil exclaimed in a relieved voice. “O’Neil says the sergeant told him he was some rich politician’s son, a black sheep, appointed in a regular regiment. That explains him somewhat.”“He’s a yellow dog, that’s what he is,” Sydney exploded, “and I’d like to tell him so to his face, and I will, the first chance I get.”“No, you won’t, Syd,” Phil said firmly; “remember ashore here we’re under his orders. Don’t give him an opportunity to"
63,a,"for the signal agreed upon with Lopez. Would he succeed in coming up with the fleeing outlaw?The night wore slowly along and morning dawned clear, finding all three of the Americans up and on the bridge of the rapidly moving vessel.No sails were in sight. A wide expanse of water was before them, while on the port hand the low swamp land of Banate was in plain sight.Phil steered his ship in toward the bamboo town nestling in the hollow of two small hills in the midst of the swampy mouth of the Mani River. As they approached, the Americans could discover naught but the usual listless life of a Filipino village.“I’ll patrol here,” Phil said, as he steered further offshore.All day long the gunboat steamed backward and forward over fifteen miles of coast line. An occasional sail was sighted and overhauled, only to find in it a handful of"
64,a,"colonel and resolved that the word of command to his men to fire should be a dear one for the smiling colonel.The lads indeed found themselves in an awkward predicament. Just the faintest thread really bound them to life, for they saw in the cruel expression in the eyes of the Filipino officer that nothing would delight him so much as to have these white men shot. Phil very much feared that in spite of his cordial words this boyish native had before now guessed the truth. However there was nothing to do but remain silent and inactive. Phil had a great desire to speak to Sydney in English, but he feared this dapper little Filipino might have learned enough of that language to understand what he might say.With his cold eye on the midshipmen the native officer gave a gruff command to his men behind him on the porch."
65,a,"cruel voice of Espinosa say.A horrible fear overcame the lad. The water cure was to be given him. He was to be half drowned. To be made to feel all the torturing sensations of a drowning man; not once but many times, until his spirit was broken and he would answer questions which would make him traitorously injure his own cause. His eyes opened, and he saw dimly Espinosa’s mocking face above him. The sun had flamed forth from under a cloud and burned down unmercifully on his staring eyes. He noted vaguely that it had passed the meridian. Then a terrible fear came into his mind. Where were the gunboat and the soldiers? Surely by this time they would have made their presence known. Had the gunboat run aground and the expedition been delayed? Would a delay mean death to him and O’Neil or only one more awful day"
66,a,"time he waited, seeing in the army man’s face that he was about to speak.“Captain Blynn has made his report,” came in metallic tones from the old campaigner, “and I am deeply distressed to hear that you,[93] Captain Perry, deliberately allowed a prisoner to escape; one whom above all I wished to lay my hands on. Blynn is for asking the admiral to court-martial you at once; but I am sure you must have some good reason for your action.”He ended and glanced questioningly at the abashed Phil.“My reason was,” the lad blurted out, his feelings much hurt at the severe arraignment, “that in order to capture Colonel Martinez, I would have had to kill him in cold blood. I couldn’t bring myself to do it for he had behaved handsomely toward us while we were his prisoners.”“But,” the general retorted, “Señor Espinosa would have saved you the trouble if"
67,a,visibly put out that he too could not be allowed to go. “I shall take only O’Neil. The general has ordered that all the soldiers who can be spared from the garrisons throughout the island be despatched to rendezvous here and will need the ‘Mindinao’ to carry troops and shell the stronghold from the river. If you find it possible take her through the cañon; there is a trail on the other side from the westward. If you are successful we shall have them between our two parties.”That evening Maria and her small brother followed their father’s body to his grave in the family cemetery. The general himself read the solemn burial service and a company of American infantry fired three volleys over the grave of the murdered patriot.General Wilson established his field headquarters in the house of mourning and before three o’clock of the next day the first of
68,a,"yards away. He could plainly see that at the top a fierce fight was raging. The narrow gorge ahead seemed barely wide enough to permit the gunboat to pass, and above it, he knew only too well great boulders were standing ready to be dropped like meteors on the frail deck of the “Mindinao.”“Are you ready there with the Colt gun?”[339] he called loudly to the sailors in the foretop, where the gun was mounted.There was no answer; a glance aloft showed him the crew of the gun grouped anxiously about it.“Jammed again, I suppose,” he exclaimed.Closer and closer loomed the cañon.“Look out for the prisoner,” Sydney cried out as he saw the native, his hands on the rail, about to leap overboard. Major Marble was near enough to grasp him and the next minute ready hands had bound him securely to the rail and from there he gazed up"
69,a,"forgetting for the moment his own trouble.“What is it, señorita?” he asked eagerly.“Come to-night to the northeast corner of the Plaza, at nine o’clock; bring some of your men with you. Maria Rodriguez will show her gratitude to the brave American officers.” He would have detained her, to learn more, but her sharp command to the alert driver had come before he could recover from the startling summons and the next moment the calesa was racing madly up the street.Full of his news, he boarded the gunboat and confided to Sydney the girl’s message.“Maria Rodriguez,” Sydney exclaimed. “She’s the daughter of Juan Rodriguez, the wealthiest Filipino in Kapay. I wonder what’s up? Her father, you know, refuses to join the insurgents, and yet will not aid the Americans, and the general will not molest[148] him. He lives on his estates just beyond the city on the river.”O’Neil was summoned and"
70,a,"must be a friend of hers, or otherwise we wouldn’t have been living to see the ‘Albany.’ If she had only been an ordinary native girl, these ladrones wouldn’t have stopped and bowed and scraped and then given us the freedom of the after deck of the ship. No, sir, she’s a person of consequence. She saved our lives and then afterward she saved the lives of Colonel Martinez and his band of cutthroats, for if they had fallen into the hands of the crew of the ‘Albany’ they would have all been shot or swung at her yard-arm. Seizing this merchant ship and killing her captain is piracy.”“I think O’Neil is right,” Sydney exclaimed patting the sailor on the back enthusiastically.[59] “The girl’s all right—I’ll take my hat off to her every time.”“It was my own stupidity, I suppose,” Phil declared, his face sobering slightly. “I thought she was"
71,a,"over and the “Negros,” unable to steer, would ground on the edge of the channel, thus leaving her helpless to be captured by the cruiser. He opened his mouth to give the signal for his companions to act, when a shrill warning cry sounded in his ears and he was roughly drawn back into his chair and the wedge dropped from his hands a foot from its goal.Brigadier-General Wilson sat at his desk in the headquarters building at Palilo. In the spacious corridors outside orderlies hurried to and fro, carrying messages from the several officers of the staff whose offices joined that of the general.Before him was a chart of his military district, and while he pondered he juggled a score or more of different colored pins with little tags attached to them. Those pins with blue heads represented soldiers of his command in the field against the enemy while"
72,a,"marks of the rope stood out in blue welts on his muscular neck. His eyes were closed, but the lad saw with joy that he was alive. He knelt by the sailor’s side ministering to him as tenderly as if he were a child. Then in great anxiety he saw that Lopez’s men were slowly giving ground. Stubbornly they fought, but the overwhelming ranks of the enemy, now alive to the actual conditions and spurred forward by their leaders, came frantically forward across the open ground.Phil dragged the senseless body of the sailor back until they were on the very edge of the hill and then a sight which made him mad with joy caused him to stand upright and swing his hat jubilantly, unheeding the leaden missiles on all sides. There scarcely a hundred yards below him struggling forward and upward was Captain Blynn and his five hundred soldiers."
73,a,"they would be killed by their enraged countrymen, while if their countrymen claimed and received aid from them they would at once be put in prison by the Americans, and yet if they refused to subscribe[109] to the cruel demands of the insurgents their lives would pay for their rashness as soon as they wandered outside of their village.He paced restlessly the silent bridge. His men he could see sleeping under the awning just below him. The man at the wheel, his eyes on the compass, and the lookout on the forecastle were alone awake and alert. The hours dragged by. A faint blush of dawn was visible on the eastern horizon when Phil through his powerful night-glass could recognize the chief landmark near the town of Binalbagan, a deep notch in the rugged coast hills through which the river in the season of rains flowed to the sea. It"
74,a,"or killed.”The midshipmen listened in delight to this plan, which fitted in so well with their own ideas.The major soon departed, promising short work in destroying the bridge if the lads discovered the river to be navigable above the house of Rodriguez.O’Neil was ordered to have a boat’s crew of four men ready to leave the gunboat at one o’clock at night. The distance to Rodriguez’s ranch was somewhat over fifteen miles and the lads did not desire to be seen, so they would pass at night and be safely within friendly land by sunrise. Rodriguez left them soon after to return by land and promised a hearty welcome on their arrival up the river.Promptly at one o’clock the expedition started. O’Neil had provided the usual gear for surveyors; a compass, a lead line, and also a rifle for each man and a revolver for himself.Silently they shoved off and"
75,a,"mountain and I hope at this end. All three will fire together and I will control from here.”The men listened gravely and returned to their guns.“Load,” Sydney ordered harshly. The breech-blocks clicked shut and the crew stood expectantly alert. The soldiers, unaccustomed[306] to artillery, unconsciously edged away from the three bow guns.“Set your sights at 1,500 yards,” Sydney directed, at the same time giving a signal to the helmsman to hold the ship steady on her course.“Fire when you’re on, aim at the edge of the rock,” he said in a tense voice.The three guns roared almost in unison and three black dots winged swiftly out toward the frowning cliffs ahead of the gunboat. Three dull brown splashes suddenly appeared just under the edge of the cliff and the reverberations died out slowly to an unearthly wail.“Seventeen hundred,” the lad cried out sharply, for the shots had fallen short of"
76,a,"but one way and that was to go to General Wilson and tell his story, which would be corroborated by Sydney. It would be tantamount to telling the general that one of his officers was an arrant coward and unfit to be trusted with hazardous expeditions. And even then the charges would still hold. They were true in substance,[139] every one of them. As commanding officer of a gunboat Phil was within his rights when he laid his plans as to where the attack of the gunboat should be and the locality to land his own men; but he could only advise the army man from his nautical experience as to where the best place would be to land the soldiers in order that their coöperation might be harmonious. Lieutenant Tillotson was free to accept his suggestions or refuse them as he saw fit. So long as they were both"
77,a,"great preparations for your reception. It is needless for me to tell you how delighted he is that you have changed your mind. He was very angry at me for not insisting on your coming with me the other day.”Phil regarded the little native, a fine scorn in his eyes. He would have liked nothing better than to have answered him in the same ironical vein, but he realized that to do so and anger him would only make more difficult their position.“He will be here to pay his respects shortly,”[312] Salas continued ironically. “Ah! here he comes now.”With his heart beating fast and the muscles in his throat tightening, Phil saw Espinosa sauntering toward them. He was dressed in the uniform of a Filipino general, made in the Spanish fashion, of a mouse-colored duck with a rolling collar, on which a silver star glistened. He came slowly forward, a"
78,a,"at his desk in the headquarters building at Palilo. In the spacious corridors outside orderlies hurried to and fro, carrying messages from the several officers of the staff whose offices joined that of the general.Before him was a chart of his military district, and while he pondered he juggled a score or more of different colored pins with little tags attached to them. Those pins with blue heads represented soldiers of his command in the field against the enemy while the ones with the green heads were the ladrones or insurrectos, whom he had been fighting without success for nearly six months.“They jump about as if they were mounted in balloons,” he exclaimed testily as he drew out several green-headed pins and replaced them in accordance with recent information[42] in other localities on the map. The big headquarters clock ticked away in silence, while the gray-haired veteran again lapsed into"
79,a,"short time appeared on deck as fresh in appearance as if they had both stepped from the proverbial band-box.A shrill whistle sounded on the gunboat followed by the call, “Lay aft, everybody.”The men filed aft on the miniature quarter-deck, lining themselves obediently on each side, and there waited.A smile stole irrepressibly to Phil’s face. Here on board this tiny ship, scarcely a hundred[89] feet long and of a little over one hundred tons displacement, the far-reaching navy regulations were being carried out with as much form and punctiliousness as they would be on the biggest battle-ship.In a graceful speech Marshall bade farewell to his small crew and then he unfolded the paper in his hand signed by no less a personage than the admiral commanding the Asiatic fleet.“You are, upon the reporting of your relief, Midshipman Philip Perry, U. S. Navy, detached from the command of the U. S. S."
80,a,"of a pretentious Filipino dwelling.“Your men must wait here, señor; it is the señorita’s order,” the native told the lads. “The officers are to come with me.” He raised his finger to his lips to caution silence. “If we are discovered it will mean death, señor.”“What’s the game, sir?” O’Neil asked eagerly, not having heard the whispered words of the native.“You’re to stay here out of sight,” Phil explained quietly. “If we need help I’ll fire my revolver.”With a parting caution the midshipmen stealthily followed their guide up the street,[150] hugging the dark shadow of the houses, and entered the wide archway of a large native building. Inside was total darkness, and it needed all their confidence in the girl who had invited them to come to still their awakening suspicions.The guide gave a low whistle and the slight sound caused their hearts to beat faster amid the profound silence"
81,a,"fit to order them to break their parole.“Thank you, señor,” Phil finally replied. “We shall take our chances as your prisoners. We shall always remember your considerate treatment of us, and if by the chances of war the situation is reversed you can count on us to repay our obligations to a chivalrous enemy.”“If you and your companions were to remain in my keeping,” the Filipino answered, a pleased smile on his face at Phil’s subtle compliment, “I should have no concern, but I must give you over to the mercies of General Diocno; he is a Tagalo, and has known nothing but war since his youth; he would never surrender to the Spaniards, and for years[66] a price has been upon his head; he is said to be cruel to those who fall into his hands.”Phil shuddered at the frank words of his captor. He saw in the earnestness"
82,a,"and scramble up the steep bank, the dripping girl clutching securely the saddle.Little Juan behaved like a veteran, guiding his horse with a gentle hand across the current until the animal’s feet took the bottom on the other side and when the horse’s back emerged, he was sitting again securely in the saddle.Just as Phil, the last to reach the shore, gained the steep ascent, a sharp crack of a rifle, followed by a loud smack as the bullet dug itself into the muddy soil, announced that those at the ranch had also discovered their presence. As Phil drew himself into the saddle shaking free his reins, a single[232] swift glance down the river showed him the two natives running toward the palm grove where the canoe was tied. A few swift strokes and they would again bar the way.“Come, Syd, we must ride ahead,” Phil cried in a fever"
83,a,"puzzled voice. “You’re too young to be a brigadier-general, although you’ve got a star there on your shoulder-strap.”Phil smiled.[166]“Yes, sentry, I am Captain Perry of the gunboat.”“Sure, sir, you can pass me, any time,” the soldier exclaimed gladly. “That was certainly great work you done in Binalbagan. All the boys is talking about you two officers and Jack O’Neil. I’d like to meet him; he must be a corker.” The sentry had grounded his rifle and now stood at ease talking sociably, very much at home with the young midshipman.“He is here,” Phil replied. “If I may pass my party, I’ll call him.”“Certainly, captain, anything you say goes with me,” the sentry returned enthusiastically.The carriage, followed by the band of a dozen natives, drove down the street away from the city. Phil caught a wave of a hand from the window as he turned and started for the gunboat and"
84,a,"was he that betrayed the Tagalos. How he gets his information no one seems to know. Did you notice,” he asked suddenly, “the expression on his face when I dragged him away from the insurgent colonel? He wanted that man’s life the worst kind, and the girl’s too, I guess. We’ve made an enemy, Mr. Perry,” the sailor added decidedly, “and one who won’t soon forget us.”Phil gave a mirthless laugh.“I don’t mind making that sort of an enemy,” he said, “but we shall have to keep our eyes open hereafter, I suppose, for Señor Espinosa.”It was broad daylight before the expedition arrived in Palilo and after a formal parting from the other Americans, which O’Neil described as “the frozen mit,” the naval men[86] separated from the soldiers and took the street leading to the water-front. There in front of the quartermaster’s depot they saw the gunboat “Mindinao” moored snugly"
85,a,"in admiration as he finished and folded the communication[142] preparatory to laying it before his chief. “He’s got grit, but I fear bad judgment. I could never see why he allowed that Martinez to escape. Espinosa says it was deliberate. Well, he must pay for his ill-judged acts. I don’t want any one about here who’s going to have qualms of conscience about killing a Filipino who won’t surrender. He handled that attack at Binalbagan splendidly, though,” he thought. “But I am afraid we’ve got to make an example of him.”As Captain Blynn approached the general’s office, he caught the sound of voices from within, and soon saw that the midshipman himself was talking earnestly with the general. Captain Blynn was not deterred; with him business was business and here was the officer charged with a grave offense.“I have a letter here, sir,” he said in his cold, official voice"
86,a,"dragged several of them trembling before their leaders.“But a half hour ago a large proa was launched from down the beach,” a native villager spoke up. “It had been waiting, and we were commanded to keep indoors on penalty of being shot. Through my bamboo shutter I saw it start.”Gregorio waited for no further words. Hastily turning to Lopez and Garcia he cried eagerly:“Light three fires on the top of the hill, the signal to the gunboat.” Then without spoken orders a half score of men helped the anxious Gregorio launch one of the small fishing boats lying high on the beach. As Lopez and his men hurried away, the native boat, with Gregorio at the helm, hoisted its bamboo sail to catch the light morning breeze and disappeared into the night.“There’s a fire ashore there, sir,” a lookout called in an eager voice as Phil accompanied by O’Neil stepped"
87,a,"to point to the conclusion that she was of importance among her people. He knew not what were those crisp words spoken the night before to prevent the fierce onslaught of the natives, but they had calmed the storm. She had saved their lives, that much was certain; and for that, even though she was at heart in sympathy with this band of pirates, he owed her his gratitude.His whole heart rebelled against the thought of captivity among the insurgents. He knew it would be a living death. Poorly nourished and without the necessities of life; exposed to[35] the savage temper of a people whose spirits fluctuated more rapidly than a tropical barometer, there seemed but little to live for. Perhaps death would be happier! His thoughts dwelt upon the stories he had heard of the atrocities committed by this same Diocno upon American soldiers who had been captured. Some"
88,a,"“Betrayed, that’s the word, and if I can lay my hand on the hound, I’ll swing him to the eaves of his own house-top.”Señor Espinosa was silent, his crafty, bead-like eyes regarding closely the angry, excited face of the judge-advocate.“Captain Gordon went on a wild-goose chase, and when he returned he found the insurgents had been in San Juan in his absence. Ten soldiers, American men, were caught, trapped, and butchered. The natives who brought me the information were vouched for by you and now you’ve got to prove to me that you’re not a sneaking traitor!”The captain’s words tumbled one after another so fast that the little Filipino could grasp only half their meaning, but the last could not be misunderstood. His brown face turned a sickly yellow, while his frightened eyes sought instinctively for some weapon of defense from[47] this terrible American, who was strong enough to tear"
89,a,"and the midshipmen bringing up the rear.“Do you think he suspects us?” Sydney whispered.“He must,” Phil answered hurriedly. “Be careful, Syd,” he added anxiously. “We’ve got to fight our way out. There seems no other way. There are twenty of them against us two.”At the top of the steps Salas turned and looked questioningly at the midshipmen. Phil dared not meet his eye for fear that the little native would see the anxiety which he strove to hide.On the floor of the big room a cloth had been spread and a repast set out.With a graceful wave of his thin hands[214] Colonel Salas made a sign for all to be seated and took, himself, the place beside Maria. Phil sat on the other side of Maria, while Sydney and little Juan were placed opposite.Their brisk ride had given them all an appetite, but the terrible predicament in which they now"
90,a,"quietly to Phil after he had in but a few words approved the proposed plan. “Blynn can settle the question of prisoners. I’d like to have Espinosa behind bars before I wire to Manila giving them this news.”Phil solemnly told of the sad fate of Lieutenant Tillotson and the general shook his head mournfully.“Maybe it is better so,” he whispered half to himself, but to Phil, standing close by, these words from the old soldier’s heart came distinctly.A detail of men carried the body of the dead officer across the battle-field, and as they passed solemnly through the joyful troops who had collected to cheer the white-haired veteran, the soldiers became suddenly silent as their eyes fell upon the stretcher and were told the identity of that figure underneath the flag. None had reverenced the officer in life,[349] but in death all were anxious to render respect.Phil told the general"
91,a,"friends had ridden so merrily but a few days before.The guard left at the ranch, consisting of two companies of soldiers, quietly stationed its sentries and took up the monotonous[356] routine of guarding the many supplies which were arriving by boats from Palilo.For several long hours the girl brooded over the situation, wondering how she could aid the friends for whom she had learned to hold a high regard. Bemoaning the fate that had made her a helpless woman, she took Juan by the hand and strolled away up the wooded slope toward the family burying grounds where the body of her father peacefully rested. Reaching the newly made mound she placed upon his grave the handful of flowers which she had gathered. In her heart was a great bitterness. Juan, too young to appreciate the magnitude of his loss, chased gleefully the monkeys which chattered in the trees about"
92,a,"princess.”Phil was about to reply when the girl herself appeared from the shadows, followed by the native chief.The lads regarded him with a mixture of feelings, admiration for his soldierly bearing and disgust at the thought of the wilful butchery they had seen him permit on the bridge of the steamer.They recognized at once that these two were of the highest caste among their people. The man’s face, almost perfect in contour, except in the cruel lines of the mouth, beamed hospitably upon them.The girl spoke quickly, breathlessly.“Colonel Martinez wishes to meet the brave Americans who would have fought unarmed against overwhelming odds and who had no thoughts of asking for quarter.”The Americans bowed, but the Filipino advanced,[29] his hand outstretched. Phil took it with almost a shudder. Why had this hand been withheld while the Spanish captain and his officers were asking for mercy scarcely five minutes before? Yet"
93,a,"swept, and soldiers could scale the difficult trail unopposed, and once through the narrows the trail leading from the stronghold could be commanded by the cannon to cut off the retreat of the insurgents. It is wonderful! But the bridge, Señor Perry,” he ended, his voice betraying his sudden disappointment; “it is strongly built and a gunboat cannot pass.”“If I find there’s water enough to float the ‘Mindinao,’” Phil replied assuredly, “the bridge will not stand in the way long.“Does your daughter know the country?” Phil asked earnestly.Rodriguez gazed a full minute at his questioner before he answered.“Every foot of it,” he added; “she was born near the stronghold. But what is your[197] intention, señor? This is no work for a woman.”Phil would willingly have bitten off his tongue for having led him into such an embarrassing situation. He could not tell Rodriguez that he wanted Maria because she alone"
94,a,"to excitement. Now I’ve been here for three months, most of the time cooling my heels at the dock with no one to talk to except a lot of hayseed volunteers who haven’t even been to sea, and now you come along and relieve me and I suppose, ‘presto,’ there’ll be something doing at once.”“I hope not until we can get a little sleep,” Phil exclaimed, smiling at Marshall’s sincerity. “I am sleepy enough to drop off standing up.”“Well,” Marshall said as he pushed back his chair and arose from the table, “I’ll be finished packing in an hour, and then you can read your orders and take command. I don’t want to miss that boat, for she makes easy connections with the transport for home. Think of it, Perry, home! Doesn’t it sound fine?” Then, seeing that the name had not stirred his listeners to a great degree of"
95,a,"that O’Neil had naught but his bare hands though the lust of battle was in his eyes. The horror of his recent torture pressed heavily on his mind and he was bending every exertion to reach the retreating insurgent leader.So closely did the Americans press their foes that the lifeless body of Lieutenant Tillotson was abandoned, and Phil stopped, kneeling at his side and gazed down into the still[334] face. There was a deep wound in the neck. Phil saw that the troubled spirit had been released. Ahead the pursuers had stopped and were firing fiercely in the direction of the retreating enemy.“We can’t allow Espinosa to escape,” the lad cried, aghast as he regained his men and saw with horror that many lay moaning on the ground.“They’re intrenched there, sir,” a sergeant exclaimed. “It would be suicide to charge them;” but Phil had gone too far and had suffered"
96,a,"along its path. About a mile away the other end of the cañon appeared, a white streak of light between the sombre rocks.The general regarded him in surprise.“How would you expect me to go?” he asked, a twinkle appearing in his eyes for a fraction of a second.“I was thinking of the danger, sir,” the lad added hurriedly in apology. “They’ll probably throw rocks down on us.”“The commanding general cannot always be three miles in the rear,” the veteran replied, now smiling broadly.Sydney had sent word to the engine room that he desired all speed possible and despite the current against them, the wooded shores were passed quickly.[305]“To your guns,” he called in a clear voice without a note of excitement. “Major,” he added turning to the adjutant-general, “some of your best shots might take station to pick off the enemy on the cliffs. Those on this end I hope"
97,a,"minds be excused through the plea of caution, but no strong man would hesitate to say that it was a case where caution should not have been considered.Sydney was beside himself with indignation when he learned of the spiteful charges of the[140] lieutenant and was for seeking him out and bestowing personal vengeance, but Phil dissuaded him from any such rash act.“I should have ordered his men out of the boats,” Phil said bitterly, “when I saw Tillotson was not coming. We might have won without them, although they were a great comfort, and if the Colt gun had gone back on us they would have been a necessity.”“What will you do?” Sydney asked, exasperated at the apparent indecision of his friend. “Tell the straight story to the general and he’ll make it hot for that dandified gentleman soldier.”“The worst of it is,” Phil replied gravely, “Tillotson is the son"
98,a,"down with their knees until he lay with his face pressed close to the prickly[63] earth. He could hear the tramp of shod feet and an occasional snatch of a song. Once he heard a sharp command in English and at another time a jest which called forth local laughter. It seemed an age since he had seen the head of this column appear, and yet the earth trembled under the tread of a multitude of feet. Finally the sounds died away. The soldiers had passed, and no attack had been made. After a long hour of waiting their guards brought out the Americans and unbound their hands, taking out the cruel gags from their mouths. Colonel Martinez appeared, still mounted upon his small gray pony.“I am very sorry,” he said politely, “but I could not run the risk of detection. That was Colonel Bane with two battalions of the"
99,a,"left, dying out gradually, as the sluggish blood flowed back again.“This is the ‘water cure,’” Captain Blynn observed as Major Lukban fired question after question at the thoroughly cowed and now tractable prisoner. “He will exact a confession from him which will give us all the information we need. If you or I did this we would be court-martialed and maybe dismissed but——” He ended with an expressive shrug.[296]Sydney turned sick at the sight of a human being tortured beyond endurance and a fear rose in his mind as he thought of poor Phil in Espinosa’s hands. As he watched, the native appeared to hesitate in answering a question, but a wave of Lukban’s hand, bringing the attending natives and the water cup nearer, caused him to answer the question immediately. Once the native refused to answer and then despite his cries of fear and struggles almost superhuman, he was"
100,a,"looked down pityingly upon the terrified natives huddled together in the bottom of the proa. Many were wounded by the Krag bullets and several had died not knowing pain, so swiftly had death come. Far astern a black curl of smoke marked the gunboat.All hands turned to willingly and administered to the stricken enemy and soon all the wounded were made as comfortable as possible, their bleeding stanched, while the two boats were being steered toward the west. The treasure was found hidden under the footboards[379] of the proa and this treasure had sealed the traitor’s doom, for in carrying it he had delayed his flight, allowing Gregorio and Lopez to all but overtake him.Inside of two hours the “Mindinao,” steaming cautiously between the numberless shoals, took the Americans and their captives on board and was steaming joyfully back to Palilo with her glad tidings.The wound in Phil’s shoulder turned"
101,a,"deliberately shoving off from the ship without him because he did not approve of the entire plan which you devised without his concurrence, and lastly reports you for insubordination when under his orders ashore and treating your superior officer with contempt. In fact,” Major Marble ended, “he has started at the top and gone to the bottom of all the military offenses.”[137]Phil gasped in astonishment. Major Marble stood gazing compassionately at his young friend, apparently hoping to hear him clear up the mystery. But Phil was silent. He must have time to think.After Phil had reached his ship he scarcely remembered how he had behaved to his anxious and sympathetic friend, Major Marble. The boy’s mind was dazed. He had not believed that Tillotson would dare make charges against him, but now that they had been made, how should he act? The mere words of each charge were only too"
102,a,"place in the bow while the others distributed themselves evenly upon the frail low seats, grasping their paddles ready to balance the boat when it was cast adrift in the swift current.Salas stood undecided upon the bank; his men had gone over the trail leading through the almost impenetrable jungle between them and the high palisade upon which was the outlaw’s stronghold.“Leave the horses here,” he said finally to his two men, “and go back to the palm grove and bring up one of the canoes we left there this morning.”Phil from his seat in the stern of the banka caught a significant look flung to him out of the eyes of the girl who was seated in the bow, her head bent gracefully backward regarding the Filipino leader. In the rear of Maria was little Juan, his small hands grasping a paddle, much too large for his strength.“Give the"
103,a,"office, “we are all a set of ninnies. Don’t start and look indignant, sir,” he added in mock severity. “You are as bad as the rest, but Blynn there is the worst of us all, for he can’t do what he’s employed to do—you and I are only plain, blunt soldiers, while he is supposed,” with fine scorn, “to be in addition lawyer and detective; a regular secret service sleuth and all that.“Here, read that,” he ended throwing the telegram on the desk. “You see it’s the same old story, and ten more men butchered through our stupidity.”The general paced up and down his office with quick, energetic steps.“I’ve a good mind to go out in the field myself,” he exclaimed, half to himself. “I am tired of these silly, costly blunders.” Then[44] he glanced through the open door into the next office to his own. “Come here, Blynn!” he"
104,a,"flashing eyes and firmly chiseled lips and chin.As Phil watched, his eyes opened wider in dread. The leader had edged, during the long speech, nearer and yet nearer to Rodriguez. Martinez was standing silently on the other side. Phil’s anxious gaze caught the flash of brightly polished steel in the hands of this masked native, now but a few feet from his intended victim. Maria saw, but her voice was frozen within her. Phil gauged the distance to the would-be murderer, for his intention was only too evident. It was not over fifty paces. Surely it was possible; he had often practiced at that distance. His revolver was now pointing at the Katipunan leader, whose hand could be seen to be stealthily rising. Phil steadied one shaking hand with the other and pulled the trigger. The loud report of the discharge was deafening, and below in an instant all was"
105,a,"accept his suggestions or refuse them as he saw fit. So long as they were both afloat the army officer could give no orders to him, nor could Phil give orders to his superior in rank. To the anxious lad it was certainly a perplexing situation. His conscience was quite clear upon the soundness of the plan he had proposed, and he felt that in carrying it out they had struck a severe blow at the insurrection and had saved the beleaguered garrison. The lieutenant’s action might in feeble minds be excused through the plea of caution, but no strong man would hesitate to say that it was a case where caution should not have been considered.Sydney was beside himself with indignation when he learned of the spiteful charges of the[140] lieutenant and was for seeking him out and bestowing personal vengeance, but Phil dissuaded him from any such rash"
106,a,"questioned. “Are we to return here?”“I shall leave some men here with them,” the Filipino leader assured him. “We shall either return by the way we came or else over the trail.“Vamos,” he concluded, waving his hand toward the large canoe which two of the natives were holding close up to the steep river bank.[219]Maria took her place in the bow while the others distributed themselves evenly upon the frail low seats, grasping their paddles ready to balance the boat when it was cast adrift in the swift current.Salas stood undecided upon the bank; his men had gone over the trail leading through the almost impenetrable jungle between them and the high palisade upon which was the outlaw’s stronghold.“Leave the horses here,” he said finally to his two men, “and go back to the palm grove and bring up one of the canoes we left there this morning.”Phil from his"
107,a,"explained to the general the manner of his escape. “The natives fear him, but without his followers and with the incumbrance of Rodriguez’s treasure, the dangers he must face will make him do his utmost to leave the island.”General Wilson listened intently, his eyes wandering over the victorious battle-field behind him where Captain Blynn’s men were quietly disarming the now docile natives.“I fear we cannot stop him now,” General Wilson said disappointedly, “but I suppose we should be satisfied with our victory. This means the end of the war on Kapay.”[347]Lukban had turned and was earnestly engaged in conversation with Lopez, and then he asked several eager questions of Garcia, who had joined the group. Finally he turned to General Wilson, his black eyes snapping with renewed eagerness.“Lopez wishes to follow him,” he exclaimed excitedly. “He will take his hundred men, who are only too anxious to see him captured"
108,a,"and the gunboat’s bow was directed toward the locality where he knew the town was even then in the throes of an attack from a savage enemy. His heart rose in his throat as his mind dwelt upon the gruesome possibilities if the handful of soldiers had been overpowered by their numerous foe. It was[110] almost with a sigh of relief that, as the gunboat approached nearer the shore, he indistinctly recognized the faint flashes of flame from rifle fire. At least the soldiers, or some of them, were still alive.All hands had been called, and on the deck of the “Mindinao” there was a scene of great activity. Boats were cast loose and supplied with the accessories of war. A grim Colt gun was mounted on its tripod ready to be carried ashore to hurl its five hundred shots a minute at the foe.Lieutenant Tillotson, after a rapid inspection"
109,a,"men. Each looked fearfully at the other. Every man mistrusted his neighbor. The girl’s heavy breathing sounded ominously loud in the lad’s ears, and he was dumb with apprehension that she would sacrifice them all by a second outburst of passionate denial. They dared not move. There was naught to do but wait. If the society determined upon a search then their one chance was to make a dash for the passageway, and hold the angry men at bay with their revolvers. O’Neil and his five men were near the entrance, and Phil felt sure that their cause was not altogether desperate.[159]After an interval that seemed hours the leader’s voice broke the heavy silence.“Who dared deny that Rodriguez has betrayed his people?” he cried.Phil’s strong fingers pressed firmly the girl’s arm and his eyes begged obedience.The masked men sat as if turned to stone. No sound broke the stillness.A loud"
110,a,"a snarl he glanced down at his almost helpless arm.“For this I took Rodriguez’s life with my own hands, although Garcia had been chosen for the deed,” he exclaimed darkly, “and for this I shall force his daughter to become the wife of Manuel Espinosa.”Phil gasped, a flood of angry blood mounting to his temples.“It was I who fired the shot,” the lad cried exultantly, “and the next time you won’t get off so easily.”Espinosa in sullen rage regarded the angry midshipman through his slit-like eyes.[316]“You?” he cried in unfeigned surprise. “How did you get there?”“I was there,” Phil replied quickly, a keen satisfaction entering his thoughts at being able to beard the lion in his den, “and afterward exposed you to the general—but,” he asked suddenly, “why did you desert? If you hadn’t we would have had a pleasant little hanging party in the Plaza the next morning.”Espinosa was"
111,a,"morning you can be on your way to Palilo.”It was certainly a grave temptation, but the midshipmen knew that in giving their parole all hopes of taking part in the war would vanish; and then, the insurgents not being recognized as belligerents, the Navy Department might even see fit to order them to break their parole.“Thank you, señor,” Phil finally replied. “We shall take our chances as your prisoners. We shall always remember your considerate treatment of us, and if by the chances of war the situation is reversed you can count on us to repay our obligations to a chivalrous enemy.”“If you and your companions were to remain in my keeping,” the Filipino answered, a pleased smile on his face at Phil’s subtle compliment, “I should have no concern, but I must give you over to the mercies of General Diocno; he is a Tagalo, and has known nothing"
112,a,"this attack and was alive he would have prevented it,” she exclaimed suddenly, her hope turning to dejection.While they were talking the fusillade slowly diminished and soon ceased altogether and in a short time Captain Blynn’s voice was heard in the hall below.In the large living-room the army and navy men sat, until the daylight sifted in[265] through the shell windows, talking of the perplexing situation, while Maria was made to go to bed and sleep. The doctor who accompanied the captain regarded her with eyes of grave concern.“She must not be overexcited. She is outwardly calm but her heart acts queerly. It may snap at any moment,” he had told the lads.“I have received a long letter from your friend, Colonel Martinez,” the captain exclaimed to the midshipmen after disposing of a steaming cup of coffee. “He said he would willingly surrender to General Wilson if the price on"
113,a,"swiftness of the current, the canoe sped toward the grassy slope where their horses were waiting. A bend in the river, and the swimmer disappeared from sight.“Why hasn’t he given the alarm?” Phil demanded nervously. “What does it mean?”“He will as soon as he reaches shore,” Maria gasped breathlessly. “The monkeys when they fall in the water always scream, so Salas knows better than to signal to all the crocodiles within hearing.”Little Juan, try as he would, could not[227] keep up with the furious pace set him by his companions, and he lay quietly balancing himself in the boat and gazing about him with frightened eyes.The skiff was run full speed against the steep bank of the river, and the midshipmen clutched eagerly the loose earth until Maria and her brother had gained the shore. Then to their expectant ears there came a loud halloo! from up the river.“There’s no"
114,a,"small rumpuses. I dare say you didn’t hear about them.” Phil’s pride was touched, for he knew that many papers had given full and even exaggerated accounts of both fights, and his name and Sydney’s had been glowingly mentioned.“I suppose I must have been out in the field[106] at the time,” Tillotson explained indifferently, “so I didn’t see the papers.”“Hadn’t we best make up a plan of just how we’re going to do this thing?” Phil urged, returning to his point and being guided by his training at the Naval Academy, which had taught him to be methodical in all things.Lieutenant Tillotson regarded the lad coldly. “You can plan for yourself,” he replied. “I’ve been fighting these insurgents for some months and my men know my plans by heart: they comprise just one word: ‘Forward.’”After the lieutenant had gone to his cot and was sound asleep, the midshipmen adjourned to"
115,a,"success of the cause is concerned. Espinosa has twice as many troops as the general, and they are fighting on their home soil. They know every footpath. Some are not armed with a rifle but are far more dangerous to us with their bolos and fanatical bravery. We did not see his stronghold, I am glad to say,” he smiled grimly at the words, “but we know that one thousand men held it successfully against five times that number of Spaniards a generation ago. From what I have seen I say concentrate every available man and crush this fellow Espinosa before he gets any stronger.”Major Marble nodded his head in agreement with the views of the young navy man.“If we could always do what our military training dictates,” he answered sadly, “this war might not have begun.”“I shall go up the river in an hour,” Phil[272] announced, “and if the"
116,a,"in its efforts to unseat the rider, but he could not be disturbed. The native followers formed about them, and the party moved slowly along the uneven road.After a half hour’s ride, Salas ordered a halt at the base of a bluff several hundred feet high. The midshipmen gazed with inward emotion at the towering cliffs ahead of them, through which ran like a torrent the muddy Tubig River.“From here we must go by banka,” the outlaw explained. “My men will go on foot, for they are accustomed to the rough trail; but for the señorita it would be impossible.”One of the natives approached his chief timidly, and spoke a few short sentences in a frightened voice.On hearing the man’s words, Salas’ face darkened in anger and he struck him brutally with his heavy whip. The startled native recoiled in terror from his incensed master.“He tells me that there is"
117,a,"ordered hoarsely. The gun-pointers when they heard the spiteful hiss of the enemy’s shell had, as though by an order, ceased their fire and waited obediently for the command which they felt sure the midshipman would give. They did not relish being fired upon and not allowed to return the fire.Sydney’s glasses were upon the cliff: he saw a group of struggling figures about the cannon, and then to his surprise and joy the black object detached itself and dropped swiftly to the water six hundred feet below.“Don’t fire,” he cried out quickly, but the gun-pointers through their sight telescopes had also been watching the struggle about their target and had waited.[338]The lad rang up full speed ahead and again the gunboat sped toward the cañon.“Open fire on the left flank of the hill,” Sydney ordered.The three-pounders barked, and shell after shell was sent against the gathering crowds forming to"
118,a,"as it flowed through them to the sea. Groves of high-topped palm trees appeared, a deeper green against the emerald background, while the water stretching toward them from the land polluted the sea with a dull brown stain—the muddy water of the river. The town of Dumaguete could not be seen, but from the curls of rising smoke, Phil knew it must be beyond the first bend of the river and screened from view by the spur-like hill stretching its length from the mountains behind to the water’s edge.The girl sat between the two midshipmen,[37] her small brother innocently unconscious of the tragedy being enacted about him, playing joyfully about the decks. Phil watched the child as a relief to his overanxious mind. He had dislodged a wedge-shaped block of wood from under the quarter boat, and was using it to frighten a large monkey which was eying him grotesquely"
119,a,"Ten soldiers, American men, were caught, trapped, and butchered. The natives who brought me the information were vouched for by you and now you’ve got to prove to me that you’re not a sneaking traitor!”The captain’s words tumbled one after another so fast that the little Filipino could grasp only half their meaning, but the last could not be misunderstood. His brown face turned a sickly yellow, while his frightened eyes sought instinctively for some weapon of defense from[47] this terrible American, who was strong enough to tear his frail body limb from limb.“Ah, señor capitan, is this your much-boasted American justice?” he gasped in a weak voice. “Am I then judged guilty without hearing my defense?” His voice became stronger as he proceeded. “Let us look over this calmly,” he begged. “I, myself, have been betrayed. In embracing the American cause, I have made many enemies among my people."
120,a,"mean?” he asked casting a glance of fear about him.“Oh, nothing,” the lad answered carelessly, “only he knows you killed Rodriguez, stole his money and tried to carry off his daughter; also by this time he will know that I’m a prisoner in your hands. And if for no other reason, you hold Lieutenant Tillotson, and his father is overturning the war department to rescue him. You made a bad fist of it there.”Phil had been watching the native leader’s anxious face, as he glanced about him as if half fearing the big American to appear suddenly from the ground. He now saw it light[318] up with keen enjoyment as his eyes encountered something which amused him. Looking up quickly the lad uttered an exclamation of horror as he realized with overwhelming force the true position in which he had placed himself and his trusted boatswain’s mate.O’Neil, bound hand and"
121,a,"by banka,” the outlaw explained. “My men will go on foot, for they are accustomed to the rough trail; but for the señorita it would be impossible.”One of the natives approached his chief timidly, and spoke a few short sentences in a frightened voice.On hearing the man’s words, Salas’ face darkened in anger and he struck him brutally with his heavy whip. The startled native recoiled in terror from his incensed master.“He tells me that there is but one banka ready,” he explained apologetically; “the other bankas are at the foot of the trail two miles up the river. The ones we used this morning I left at the ranch. I am sorry, but as only five[218] can go in this boat some of the party must walk. Who shall it be?” he asked abruptly.“There are just five of us,” Maria suggested enthusiastically. “My brother and I are at home"
122,a,"here was the officer charged with a grave offense.“I have a letter here, sir,” he said in his cold, official voice addressing his chief, “written by Lieutenant Tillotson, making very serious charges of misconduct against Midshipman Perry.”“Captain Perry has just told me that he had heard of these charges,” the general replied in an annoyed voice. “It seems to me,[143] Perry, you have stirred up quite a hornet’s nest in the few days you have been in Kapay.”Phil blushed furiously, and his eyes flared forth his indignation at such an unfair remark. Especially as he could make no answer to an officer of such rank.The general adjusted his glasses and read from beginning to end the report placed on his desk by the captain; then he glanced up, a puzzled look on his deeply lined face.“This is a very ugly business,” he said sharply. “We have no time to investigate"
123,a,"next time you won’t get off so easily.”Espinosa in sullen rage regarded the angry midshipman through his slit-like eyes.[316]“You?” he cried in unfeigned surprise. “How did you get there?”“I was there,” Phil replied quickly, a keen satisfaction entering his thoughts at being able to beard the lion in his den, “and afterward exposed you to the general—but,” he asked suddenly, “why did you desert? If you hadn’t we would have had a pleasant little hanging party in the Plaza the next morning.”Espinosa was evidently enraged at the lad’s daring words.“You are brave,” he said suddenly, a spark of suspicion coming into his mind, “to speak this way before me knowing that I can have you hung, or tortured, by simply giving the order.”“I know your yellow soul too well,” Phil declared in answer, “to believe that anything I might say now would influence the plan for revenge which you have"
124,a,"it up clear of the backing screws until the outrigger was alongside the gangway.“Make room for ten of our sailors,” he shouted to Martinez. “We want men who know how to shoot.”[371]While the water boiled above the swiftly revolving propellers slowly hauling the gunboat backward from its perilous position on a coral reef, all but two of the natives in the fishing boat climbed nimbly aboard and ten eager sailors, their rifles in hand, scrambled in.The sharp detonations of the three-pounder added to the confusion of the scene.As he saw the “Mindinao” was again afloat, Phil turned his eyes to the fleeing enemy. The boat, still untouched, was sailing swiftly away with an ever-increasing breeze behind it. Then his eyes opened in surprise and joy as he saw what Sydney had been doing.“Come on, O’Neil, she’s nearly out of range,” he called excitedly. The sailor turned, took in the situation"
125,a,"and upon your arrival assume command of the U. S. S. ‘Mindinao’ as the relief of Ensign Charles Marshall, U. S. Navy.”[90]For a moment there was complete silence, broken in an instant by a hoarse voice.“Three cheers for Captain Marshall.”From twenty-five strong chests the cheers were given, while the happy man honored blushed with pleasurable pride and manly tears welled to his eyes. And then Phil’s turn came to blush and look confused, and as he said afterward, foolish, when the same loud voice proposed, “Three cheers for Captain Perry.”Immediately the cheering was over the boatswain’s mate’s pipe sounded shrilly and the men, touching their caps respectfully, returned to their quarters forward.The lads saw Marshall sail away on a small island steamer similar to the one on which they had commenced their journey four days before and then returned to sit upon the quarter-deck of their gunboat and enjoy the"
126,a,"of the discharge came to their expectant ears.Phil saw with sinking heart that the “Negros” had entered the discolored water from the river. Ahead less than two miles the ever-present bamboo fish weirs showed the commencement of the shallows of the Davao River. His hopes died within him. The cruiser was not making the speed he had hoped. She would hardly be in range before the “Negros” had put the high spur of land between her and the enemy. The cruiser, apparently seeing the quarry was about to escape, opened a rapid fire in hopes of intimidating or crippling its prey; but the range was too great. The shells hissed close to the stern of the fleeing vessel; the boasted accuracy of American gunners was lacking.“If she was only a thousand yards closer,” O’Neil cried in bitter disappointment. “It’s[39] only a matter of luck at this distance. Look out,” he"
127,a,"rats; I am going to have every native of prominence in the town arrested at once. Thanks to you, we have at last found the leak.”Throwing the cringing native from him, he strode out of the door, and the lads heard the rumble of his carriage wheels as he drove rapidly away.After the captain’s menacing presence had been removed the half dozen captive Filipinos showed signs of restlessness, and once or twice Phil surprised a covert glance toward a dark corner of the large living-room. Both lads felt the responsibility of their position. They knew that they were outside of the line of sentries, almost beyond the sound of firearms. It seemed to Phil that the captain was over-reckless in coming with only themselves into the haunts of a probable enemy. Both lads were armed, their revolvers were held ready in hand and their[183] prisoners knew full well that Americans"
128,a,"position between the fire of the two opposing forces. He looked wildly about him for Lopez, but he was nowhere in sight, and already the soldiers had begun to open a withering fire in their direction. Mad with their exertions, brought suddenly face to face with the enemy, the soldiers would have no discretion; friend and foe alike were mixed in one writhing mass of brown.Then a sinister face showed itself on his right hand and all thoughts of safety were thrown to the winds. Espinosa, the tyrant and murderer, was within his reach. With a score of men as a body-guard he was hurrying away, deserting the field of battle. The midshipman pressed against the enemy to his[333] right, fighting his way even through the remnant of the loyal natives, crying out to them to follow, while behind him he could hear the heavy footfalls of the soldiers.A body"
129,a,"their lusty cheers.“Will you come to the ranch with me and surrender there to the Americans?” Maria asked, after the cheering had died away.Gregorio shook his head.“My first quest is Espinosa,” he replied earnestly. “At once we shall march toward the stronghold. If he is captured or killed in the battle I shall seek General Wilson and surrender myself and men. If Espinosa escapes I shall follow him to the death.”[360]Maria knew the native spirit too well to attempt to urge her brother to give up this perilous quest of their father’s murderer, so she bowed her head submissively.An hour saw the band on the march, with Maria and Juan mounted on two ponies; quietly the native soldiers led by Gregorio Rodriguez circled the Americans encamped at the ranch and struck the trail taken in the morning by Captain Blynn and his five hundred soldiers.Long before they came in sight"
130,a,"now regained his old confidence and cruel arrogance, while he fired question after question at the uncomfortable native.The Presidente sat motionless in his chair long after his messenger had gone. His servant came noiselessly into the room several times but tiptoed away, believing his master was asleep. But Espinosa was far from sleep, his brain was actively at work. How could he hold his position and yet remain undiscovered to this terrible Captain Blynn? He shuddered as he remembered those big hands as they worked longingly to grasp his slender neck. He was not a fighting man; the inheritance of his father’s Chinese blood mixed with the cruelty in the native strain qualified[52] him only for plotting. Others could do the fighting. His brain and cunning would furnish them the means and opportunity. But Rodriguez—he was too honest, and knew too much; he stood a menacing figure in his path"
131,a,"continued, “but if the natives are in great force such a handful cannot last long.”An hour later, Lieutenant Tillotson, a thin, blonde-haired youngster, marched his khaki-clad men on board and joined the little group of officers about the table on the quarter-deck.Phil gave the young soldier a look of close scrutiny as he unbuckled the revolver from about his slim waist and laid it on the hatch top. There was nothing soldierly in the newcomer’s appearance, and Phil unconsciously gave a sigh of disappointment. On the officer’s collar between the crossed rifles was a single numeral.“And a regular, too,” he thought.“Good luck,” Major Marble cried as he passed over the gangway on to the dock while the gunboat heaved up its anchor from the muddy bottom of the river and steamed swiftly for the outer harbor.Phil studied carefully the chart in his miniature[103] wheel house forward. “Ninety miles,” he mused"
132,a,"seeing that a struggle was still going forward on the eastern side of the mountain, gathered a force of soldiers about him and hastened to aid those still in the throes of combat.Almost out of breath the reinforcing column arrived in time to greet Phil and O’Neil standing on the brink of the precipice and hear their exclamations of disappointment at the escape of the coveted insurgent leader.Lukban was the first to recover from the stunning news that Espinosa had, by a miracle, escaped out of the Americans’ hands when all outlets were supposed to have been covered.“He doesn’t dare stay in Kapay,” the native exclaimed after Phil had explained to the general the manner of his escape. “The natives fear him, but without his followers and with the incumbrance of Rodriguez’s treasure, the dangers he must face will make him do his utmost to leave the island.”General Wilson listened"
133,a,"the rocking canoe had spoiled their aim. The missiles sang harmlessly above the lads’ heads.On a mad gallop the two midshipmen rushed out upon the clearing, revolvers in hand. As if on drill, the two horses were drawn back upon their haunches and the Americans’ weapons spoke furiously—shot after shot struck about the panic-stricken natives. They first attempted to paddle away, but the close hiss of the bullets became more than their waning courage could stand. Forgetting their rifles in their mad fear, they jumped overboard and dived below the surface of the water, while the empty canoe, in the grasp of the current, went sailing swiftly down-stream, forever beyond their reach.With wild exultation the midshipmen turned and raced after their fleeing friends.Darkness overtook them long before they could again recross the river and take the wide trail on which it was possible to ride with greater speed.It was after"
134,a,"gunners was lacking.“If she was only a thousand yards closer,” O’Neil cried in bitter disappointment. “It’s[39] only a matter of luck at this distance. Look out,” he yelled as a shell struck the water with the noise of an express train, within fifty feet of the fleeing “Negros.”The Filipino girl’s face blanched, while the boy ran cowering to his sister’s side. The danger to them seemed almost supernatural. The girl’s lips moved, and Phil saw that she was praying. For a moment a fear seized him. The thought of their danger was certainly unnerving. A single shell exploding near them would send them all to eternity. The fish weirs were now abreast the ship and the “Negros’” bow was being guided into the narrow, tortuous channel of the delta. The Filipino pilot on the bridge spun his steering wheel from side to side, following the twisting channel. The quadrant with"
135,a,"While Phil spoke he drew the chart toward him and[107] glanced carefully at the land in the neighborhood of Binalbagan.“Do you see that marsh behind the town?” he exclaimed suddenly to Sydney whose eyes were upon the chart. “That’s probably mangrove, and they can’t get through that, so if they’re attacking, it’ll be from the side. If Tillotson lands his men to the northward and we take a position to the southward we ought to make a big haul. I told O’Neil to have the Colt gun ready and if it comes out as I hope it will, we’ll land it there,” pointing to a spot on the chart showing a low hill to the left of the town.Sydney agreed heartily with Phil’s plans, and berated soundly the attitude of the army man.“I suppose,” Phil said in apology for him as they parted, one to turn in, the other to"
136,a,"mercy those still struggling in the water. To attempt to unbutton the flap of the holster and take the revolver without the owner’s knowledge was impossible. Phil needed both of his hands to wield the heavy paddle and if he stopped paddling Salas would at once suspect treachery. His heart rose in his throat and his pulses throbbed painfully as a bold plan flashed suddenly into his thoughts. It seemed the one chance of escape. At the rate the boat was going it would soon be at the foot of the trail to the stronghold where Salas’ men would be waiting in force to escort them up the steep incline to the top of the mountain. A huge crocodile lay asleep about a hundred yards ahead and this sight had awakened the plan to action in Phil’s mind.“Go slowly,” he whispered loud enough to be heard by all in the"
137,a,"Tillotson is my prisoner. I will surrender him safely in exchange for the deserter Colonel Martinez. If you attack me I shall have him shot.Phil stood silently by, his mind occupied over the details of a daring plan.The exchange proposed by Espinosa was out of the question, even if Colonel Martinez had surrendered, which he had not done up to the present time; and until his sins in Luzon were forgiven Phil knew that he preferred his liberty. But this threat against Tillotson’s life worried Phil. Espinosa was sufficiently cruel to carry it out, he was sure.Leaving the group of officers, who were still pondering over the contents of Espinosa’s communication, Phil went in search of Maria. There were points in his plan which she could throw light upon.He found her in the house, heavy-eyed with sorrow and loss of sleep, but she greeted him with a smile and waited"
138,a,"gray pony.“I am very sorry,” he said politely, “but I could not run the risk of detection. That was Colonel Bane with two battalions of the Seventy-eighth Infantry. I had been warned that he was in the neighborhood. I was not strong enough to attack him.”Phil could have cried aloud at the utter uselessness of this warfare. Their movements heralded far and wide whenever a column moved, in a country well-nigh impenetrable, how were the Americans ever to put down this ugly rebellion?[64]At sunset the band halted and went into camp. Phil saw that the site selected was a strong one and one that could be easily defended from attack if the attackers came by trail, and there seemed no other way through the impenetrable brush.“We shall remain here until my messenger returns,” Phil overheard Colonel Martinez say to the girl. “Will you wait until your father sends for you,"
139,a,"reigned. The girl was speaking in her native tongue. Phil cast a swift glance behind him; she stood boldly upright in the bow of the boat, like a beautiful bronze statue. The light threw her face in high relief against the[27] black background of sky. He saw the flashing eyes, the quivering straight nostrils, and the scornful curve of her mouth. She finished speaking, and still the silence was unbroken. From the gathered crowd the leader advanced, his hand held above his head in mute sign of peace. Phil could scarcely believe his eyes, but the girl’s low voice in his ear caused his heart to beat tumultuously.“He has accepted your surrender.” She spoke in Spanish. Then, with her hands placed lightly on Phil’s shoulder she jumped down to the deck and advanced to meet the native leader. At a few paces from her he halted, and the Americans held"
140,a,"to fire a warning shot.”“One sentry,” the captain replied quickly, “reported having heard a shot from the part of town near the sea, but he said it was very indistinct, and after all he was not sure.”Phil and Sydney exchanged glances and the captain looked up sharply, a faint suspicion entering his thoughts.[169]“What I’d like to know,” he added coldly, “is who was in that closed carriage; the sentry says there were four people.”Phil flushed as he read the insinuation in the captain’s voice.“Juan Rodriguez, his daughter and a Filipino overseer by the name of Lopez,” he answered promptly, but he lowered his eyes before the direct, searching gaze of the judge-advocate general. The presence of Colonel Martinez need not be told. It would but complicate the case and not aid in the search for Tillotson; but the army officer knew human nature too accurately, and Phil was too poor"
141,a,"of the Americans’ hands when all outlets were supposed to have been covered.“He doesn’t dare stay in Kapay,” the native exclaimed after Phil had explained to the general the manner of his escape. “The natives fear him, but without his followers and with the incumbrance of Rodriguez’s treasure, the dangers he must face will make him do his utmost to leave the island.”General Wilson listened intently, his eyes wandering over the victorious battle-field behind him where Captain Blynn’s men were quietly disarming the now docile natives.“I fear we cannot stop him now,” General Wilson said disappointedly, “but I suppose we should be satisfied with our victory. This means the end of the war on Kapay.”[347]Lukban had turned and was earnestly engaged in conversation with Lopez, and then he asked several eager questions of Garcia, who had joined the group. Finally he turned to General Wilson, his black eyes snapping with"
142,a,"cast off from the dock and steamed up the river.“That was a fine piece of work,” Phil exclaimed in admiration, as he examined the cleverly constructed drawbridge built within the twenty-four hours by the army engineers. Its width was just sufficient to admit the “Mindinao.”Phil stood on the bridge beside the man at the wheel, piloting the gunboat through the ever-changing shoals, while O’Neil in person heaved the lead in the chains, calling out the depth in feet.After leaving the town the river ran through several miles of nipa swamp land, the home of the carnivorous land crab, the crocodile and the bandit Filipino. The[273] gunboat continued cautiously, Phil keeping the sharp bow within the deep water, sometimes so close to the thickly wooded shore that he could have reached out and touched with his hand the overhanging trees.Before noon the “Mindinao” had anchored off Rodriguez’s ranch and the general"
143,a,"bitterly, “when I saw Tillotson was not coming. We might have won without them, although they were a great comfort, and if the Colt gun had gone back on us they would have been a necessity.”“What will you do?” Sydney asked, exasperated at the apparent indecision of his friend. “Tell the straight story to the general and he’ll make it hot for that dandified gentleman soldier.”“The worst of it is,” Phil replied gravely, “Tillotson is the son of an influential man in the Philippine government, and if he takes our part the general will incur the father’s displeasure, for a father will never believe wrong of a son. A general has been suspended for less, and that would ruin his army career. I think our best plan is to try to compromise with Tillotson, and if he won’t listen to reason then ask the general to send us to another"
144,a,"conscience about killing a Filipino who won’t surrender. He handled that attack at Binalbagan splendidly, though,” he thought. “But I am afraid we’ve got to make an example of him.”As Captain Blynn approached the general’s office, he caught the sound of voices from within, and soon saw that the midshipman himself was talking earnestly with the general. Captain Blynn was not deterred; with him business was business and here was the officer charged with a grave offense.“I have a letter here, sir,” he said in his cold, official voice addressing his chief, “written by Lieutenant Tillotson, making very serious charges of misconduct against Midshipman Perry.”“Captain Perry has just told me that he had heard of these charges,” the general replied in an annoyed voice. “It seems to me,[143] Perry, you have stirred up quite a hornet’s nest in the few days you have been in Kapay.”Phil blushed furiously, and his"
145,a,"the streak of dawn ever increasing in the eastern sky.“Come on, Tillotson,” Phil said harshly; “we’ve wasted too much time already.”[115]Lieutenant Tillotson stopped on the gangway and glared angrily at the composed midshipman below him.“I’d like to know,” he sneered, “what business a midshipman has to give orders to his superior officer.”“I’ll give you one more chance, Tillotson,” Phil said in a stern, tense whisper; he did not wish the men to hear. He could see even in the dim light the surprised, incredulous look on the faces of his sailors. “Will you please get aboard?”The lieutenant remained motionless, a dark scowl on his face.“Shove off,” Phil ordered harshly.The boats cleared the gangway. The sailors dipped their oar blades, ready to follow the leading boat in which was Phil and the trusty Colt.“Come back here,” the lieutenant cried, seeing he had gone too far. But Phil’s jaw was set and"
146,a,"toward the gangway, the smile having disappeared and the alert business expression taking its place on his face.The midshipmen watched him cross the gangway and join the general, who had been taking his usual morning exercise before going to his office, and as the two walked along apparently deep in conversation an orderly stopped them, handing a telegram to the general. The lads saw him open it and read and then pass it to Captain Blynn. Both turned as if by a mutual impulse and glanced toward the gunboat, then changing their minds apparently, they again turned and walked briskly toward the headquarters building.“Something in the telegram concerns us in some way,” exclaimed the analytical Sydney. “I wonder what it said?” But Phil’s mind was too much occupied in thinking of the chameleon character of his new friend to give more than a passing thought to the contents of the"
147,a,"too strong not to take the warning. He caught Sydney’s arm and wheeled him away from the house. The lads had not taken a half dozen steps before a shrill cry from Maria riveted them in their tracks. Over their shoulders they saw that now the porch was filled with natives who were pointing their rifles at them menacingly.“Come on, we might as well face them,”[207] Phil whispered, his teeth tightly clenched and with his hand on his pistol.Turning, Phil led the way back to the steps, and there he halted, glancing inquiringly at the unfriendly guns covering him.A native, apparently an officer, dressed in a dull gray cotton uniform, walked slowly toward him down the rickety steps.“How dare you insult me and my friends on my own door-step?” Maria’s voice was high pitched in anger. “These gentlemen are my guests. By what right are you here?”The Filipino officer had"
148,a,"was she at home and safe among them? The respect shown her by the leader and his men seemed to point to the conclusion that she was of importance among her people. He knew not what were those crisp words spoken the night before to prevent the fierce onslaught of the natives, but they had calmed the storm. She had saved their lives, that much was certain; and for that, even though she was at heart in sympathy with this band of pirates, he owed her his gratitude.His whole heart rebelled against the thought of captivity among the insurgents. He knew it would be a living death. Poorly nourished and without the necessities of life; exposed to[35] the savage temper of a people whose spirits fluctuated more rapidly than a tropical barometer, there seemed but little to live for. Perhaps death would be happier! His thoughts dwelt upon the stories"
149,a,"for their work from Garcia, bound and helpless where your sailors had left him. They refused to liberate him and hoped he would be killed by the Americans. You can be sure,” she added, “that he will take keen pleasure in running his enemies to earth.”“And now for my favor from you,” the lad continued in a lower tone; “as Garcia will take Lopez’s place as guide for the soldiers to the trail up the mountain, I want twenty-five of your men whom you would trust to the death, under the command of Lopez, to take O’Neil and me as prisoners to Espinosa’s camp.”[279]The girl gave a low exclamation of surprised horror, regarding Phil fixedly, half believing the lad was out of his mind.“I mean it,” he exclaimed earnestly. “It’s the only chance we have of saving Tillotson’s life. Your men must pretend to have deserted after the death of"
150,a,"in an agony of suspense. The cool handle of Phil’s revolver, which he had unconsciously drawn[154] from its holster, brought back his confidence. At least they would not die without some injury to their enemy.Again came the flash of light; it flickered and seemed on the point of extinction, and then continued dimly. Phil recognized that this time the match had not gone out in the room over which their gallery looked, and that a candle was dimly burning. Then another and another candle was lighted and little by little the great room was exposed to their view.Figures of men could be seen clustered about a table in the far end of the hall, some seated in chairs, but most of them on the ground in native fashion, while beyond the table was a niche in which an image glittered. The midshipmen soon discovered that it was an exaggerated emblem"
151,a,"the South Seas.”[6][8]The “Isla de Negros,” a small inter-island steamer, lay moored alongside the dock in the turbulent waters of the Pasig River, the commercial artery of the city of Manila. As the last of its cargo was noisily carried on board by a swarm of half-naked stevedores, the slender lines which held the steamer to the stone quay were cast off, and with many shrill screeches from its high treble whistle the steamer swung its blunt bow out into the strength of the current.On the upper deck of the vessel, clad in white naval uniforms, two United States midshipmen stood in silent contemplation of the activity about them. They watched with undisguised interest the hundreds of toiling[10] orientals; resembling many ant swarms, traveling and retraveling incessantly between the countless hulls of steamers and lorchas and the long rows of hastily constructed storehouses facing the river frontage. Here and there"
152,a,"stern judge-advocate was unused to such treatment; he had always bullied those under him and in a measure by the very force of his will, many of those senior to him in rank. But angry as he was he realized that the midshipman was quite within his rights. He was on board his own ship, and there he was supreme.“Captain Blynn, I hope it will not be necessary for me to have you escorted across[172] the gangway,” Phil reiterated, his voice showing perfect control of temper. The lad glanced forward meaningly to where many of the crew had collected, intently listening to the heated colloquy between their young captain and this big, blustering army officer.Then a voice from the dock made both the combatants turn suddenly and gaze in surprise at the general, who, unobserved, had stopped abreast them and had been an amused spectator of the discomfiture of his"
153,a,"bulging from their sockets, that the unfortunate man would surely be severed into a thousand pieces by these fierce, savage fanatics, but he stood silent, his arms folded across his breast, while his eyes gleamed in exultant excitement.Slowly the members danced by their new comrade and returned to their seats.Then the new member, by sign from the leader, advanced and prostrated himself before the emblem.“The sign of giving his life to the cause,” Maria whispered. Then she stiffened and a stifled sob broke from between her clenched lips as the voice of the speaker filled the room.“Rodriguez has refused the summons. He is no longer our friend. He has gone over to the despised Americans. Through him our men were attacked and killed at Banate, and also at Binalbagan. He holds his servants from joining our cause only through fear. Once he is removed they will all join us.”“It is"
154,a,"be gained here, and the evidence that others had been on this spot very recently was too strong not to take the warning. He caught Sydney’s arm and wheeled him away from the house. The lads had not taken a half dozen steps before a shrill cry from Maria riveted them in their tracks. Over their shoulders they saw that now the porch was filled with natives who were pointing their rifles at them menacingly.“Come on, we might as well face them,”[207] Phil whispered, his teeth tightly clenched and with his hand on his pistol.Turning, Phil led the way back to the steps, and there he halted, glancing inquiringly at the unfriendly guns covering him.A native, apparently an officer, dressed in a dull gray cotton uniform, walked slowly toward him down the rickety steps.“How dare you insult me and my friends on my own door-step?” Maria’s voice was high pitched"
155,a,"Philip Perry, U. S. Navy, detached from the command of the U. S. S. ‘Mindinao’ and will proceed immediately to Manila, reporting your arrival, for passage to your home, to the senior officer present.”As soon as Marshall’s voice died away, Phil began to read his own orders, which he had kept safely pinned to the inside of his breast-pocket during the last few exciting days.“You are hereby detached from the U. S. S. ‘Phœnix’ and will proceed to Palilo, Island of Kapay, Philippine Islands, and upon your arrival assume command of the U. S. S. ‘Mindinao’ as the relief of Ensign Charles Marshall, U. S. Navy.”[90]For a moment there was complete silence, broken in an instant by a hoarse voice.“Three cheers for Captain Marshall.”From twenty-five strong chests the cheers were given, while the happy man honored blushed with pleasurable pride and manly tears welled to his eyes. And then Phil’s"
156,a,"a new and sagacious enemy in Espinosa. The remaining members of the Katipunan society had taken flight, and had fled before the vengeance of Captain Blynn whom they all hated and feared. Rodriguez had been killed, and enough gold to continue the war indefinitely had been taken almost before their eyes, and they had been powerless to prevent it. This was not a pleasant retrospective dream in which to indulge as they watched in silence the even breathing of the complacent army man.[269]“We seem so powerless against them,” Sydney complained. “Our enemies are everywhere. One moment the natives about us seem friendly, and the next they are sticking us in the back with knives. When we start on an expedition the enemy know just how many men we have and where we are going, so there can be no surprise, while they always take us unawares.”“But now, it’s different since"
157,a,"of his anger and mortification the remark of his favorite brought a faint smile to Phil’s face.“I guess you’re right, Jack,” he replied, his voice shaking with emotion, calling him unconsciously by the name which he always used in his thoughts, and allowed himself to be led away.The midshipman called his men together and walked quietly toward the beach, while Lieutenant Tillotson took entire charge of gathering up the spoils.[128]“The lieutenant’s compliments, sir,” spoke an orderly at Phil’s side as he was about to step into his boat to go to the “Mindinao,” where at least he did have some status. “And he says, he orders you to send your men to report to him to put things in order.”Phil turned on the messenger fiercely, and then in time remembered the soldier was but the innocent bearer of this insolent command.“Come on, O’Neil,” the lad said with a tone of"
158,a,"pleased smile on his face at Phil’s subtle compliment, “I should have no concern, but I must give you over to the mercies of General Diocno; he is a Tagalo, and has known nothing but war since his youth; he would never surrender to the Spaniards, and for years[66] a price has been upon his head; he is said to be cruel to those who fall into his hands.”Phil shuddered at the frank words of his captor. He saw in the earnestness of his face that this gruesome information was being given for the Americans’ own good.“Your friends,” the colonel continued, “will doubtless attempt a rescue, and that will only add to your danger.”After Colonel Martinez had said good-night Phil told his companions of the unpleasant and disquieting reports concerning their future captor, but nothing could shake O’Neil’s good spirits.“It’s all in the game, Mr. Perry,” he said philosophically. “They"
159,a,"happened to account for this early morning visit. The army man did not keep them long in suspense, and had his say with his usual directness.“Lieutenant Tillotson, the officer of the guard yesterday, is missing. His bed shows that he did not sleep in it at all last night. I have investigated the case as far as I have been able, and I find that no one passed through the sentries except a closed carriage and a squad of Filipinos. This sentry says that you and Mr. Monroe vouched for them. Tillotson was last seen an hour before this[168] time by a sentry at the bridge whom he visited. As soon as I heard of the carriage episode I cautioned the sentry to say nothing. I wanted to see you and clear up that part before I investigated further.”Phil sat speechless in his seat while the judge-advocate general talked on"
160,a,"and spotless white uniform.Refreshed by even this short nap the midshipmen opened their trunks, which had been carried over nearly sixty miles of rough country on the shoulders of stalwart native carriers, and in an incredibly short time appeared on deck as fresh in appearance as if they had both stepped from the proverbial band-box.A shrill whistle sounded on the gunboat followed by the call, “Lay aft, everybody.”The men filed aft on the miniature quarter-deck, lining themselves obediently on each side, and there waited.A smile stole irrepressibly to Phil’s face. Here on board this tiny ship, scarcely a hundred[89] feet long and of a little over one hundred tons displacement, the far-reaching navy regulations were being carried out with as much form and punctiliousness as they would be on the biggest battle-ship.In a graceful speech Marshall bade farewell to his small crew and then he unfolded the paper in his"
161,a,"voice, “that, I said, was six months ago; we’ve been bailing out there ever since, awnings furled, guns loaded, expecting to be boarded every night.” He made a gesture of utter disgust as he stopped.“They don’t know anything, these gugus,” he began again, seeing that his friends didn’t understand his disjointed explanation; “they won’t try to board a man-of-war. They’ll attack you on shore; but as for paddling out in their canoes to capture a steel monitor, it’s too absurd. Yet we stood watch on and watch off every night waiting for ’em to board. Do you blame me, sir, for feeling happy when I got these orders?” tapping his telegram against an awning stanchion. “This means life again; like we had in the dago country and up with them pigtailed chinks.”The midshipmen slapped the loquacious sailor joyfully on the back.[14]“You’re not half as glad to be with us as"
162,a,"behind Juan, señor. I’m afraid he might fall overboard and I don’t[220] know what my father would do if anything should happen to him.”The outlaw smiled and took the empty seat, taking from the boy’s unwilling hands the large paddle.“Bueno,” he exclaimed, while the two men released the boat, pushing it gently away out into the stream.Under the strong strokes of four paddles, for the midshipmen were both expert, having owned canoes at the Naval Academy, the native boat swept swiftly through the water. To avoid the strength of the current the canoe was steered close in to the steep bank under the protecting shade of the overhanging trees. Great crocodiles basking on the muddy banks were passed, the animals slinking away as the boat approached, their long tails lashing furiously in their haste. Monkeys filled the trees, whistling and jabbering fearlessly as the boat passed under them.While Phil exerted"
163,a,"those who had been torturing him, now that they were being indulged in a more interesting spectacle.Lopez, his heart beating and his bronze face set determinedly, watched the two topmasts of the gunboat as they traveled toward the bend in the river. The next second the “Mindinao’s” white bow came slowly, majestically from behind the land and turned gracefully up the river toward the cañon. At the foot of the trail khaki-clad figures suddenly appeared and mounted slowly up the narrow path. He could see the guides in front clearing and uncovering the treacherous man traps. His men had now seen the approaching deliverers and their black eyes snapped excitedly. Any one with half an eye would have known that something out of the ordinary was going forward. The eager[327] brown soldiers of Rodriguez moved about restlessly, glancing excitedly down into the valley below them. Fortunately the leader and his"
164,a,"joy at the good news it brought. He read in the natives’ eyes a look of terror at the sudden appearance of an unlooked for enemy, and at the same instant he realized that if he and his loyal natives were to be saved he must extricate them from this dangerous position between the fire of the two opposing forces. He looked wildly about him for Lopez, but he was nowhere in sight, and already the soldiers had begun to open a withering fire in their direction. Mad with their exertions, brought suddenly face to face with the enemy, the soldiers would have no discretion; friend and foe alike were mixed in one writhing mass of brown.Then a sinister face showed itself on his right hand and all thoughts of safety were thrown to the winds. Espinosa, the tyrant and murderer, was within his reach. With a score of men"
165,a,"foolhardy to risk my men against such odds.”“He does think of his men, then,” Phil thought contemptuously.The gunboat had now stopped and lay motionless on the quiet sea. Without orders[112] four boats fully manned with ready sailormen were noiselessly lowered from the davits. Stalwart arms lifted the Colt gun and placed it in the bow of a cutter. Phil gave a last careful search through his glass at the shore line, scarce a thousand yards away. He could see the shadowy form of the big white cathedral from which tongues of flame darted incessantly. To the right the long, low convent building was silent. The soldiers had seized the church and inside its shelter they were making their last stand. Phil was assured that they would be safe until their ammunition was exhausted, and his experience had taught him that soldiers in such straits, unless there was an officer to"
166,a,"know of no insurgent officer of that name. Yet he’s here, and from all accounts has been expected. Most of his party were destroyed by Blynn, but about seventy-five are believed to have escaped, and Espinosa says that his followers are landing every day in the neighborhood of Dumaguete. I think the general’s plan is to have you cruise off there in hopes of intercepting some of their war parties.”Phil had composed his ruffled feelings and listened eagerly while Major Marble was talking. His heart sank within him as there flashed through his mind thoughts as to whom Martinez might be. Maybe no less a[98] personage than Aguinaldo himself, or General Rios, had been within his grasp. Small wonder that Captain Blynn was put out at his escape. Yet he could not have done otherwise with the girl’s beseeching, pleading eyes upon him.After leaving Major Marble’s quarters the lads took"
167,a,"him in a confiding voice. “It was a natural mistake for you to make, Señor——” she stopped questioningly, and he supplied the name. “Salas, colonel in the Filipino army, señorita, at your service,” he said bowing gallantly.Maria had not guessed at the officer’s identity although she knew most of the important leaders, having known them as a girl at her father’s house before the war had begun. Now the mention of his name almost made her heart stop beating. This frail creature, with the face and figure of a boy, was feared by all who had fallen under his control. He had won the unenviable reputation of being the most cruel of the insurgent leaders, first in Luzon under Aguinaldo and then on the island of Kapay. He was scarcely older than Phil, and yet he held the rank of colonel.“Your name, señor,” she smiled, “is one[210] well known throughout"
168,a,"surprised, incredulous look on the faces of his sailors. “Will you please get aboard?”The lieutenant remained motionless, a dark scowl on his face.“Shove off,” Phil ordered harshly.The boats cleared the gangway. The sailors dipped their oar blades, ready to follow the leading boat in which was Phil and the trusty Colt.“Come back here,” the lieutenant cried, seeing he had gone too far. But Phil’s jaw was set and he turned to him a deaf ear.“It’s his own fault,” Phil confided to O’Neil at his side. “I didn’t order his men in the boats; they got in without orders, as any decent men would do. What is it, O’Neil, just pure cold feet?” he asked suddenly.[116]“Partly that, sir,” O’Neil answered, “but Lieutenant Tillotson is not a coward; he’s just overcautious and a bit of a braggart. He didn’t like attacking in the dark.”The four boats pulled with oars muffled in toward"
169,a,"the heads of their enemy had taken fright, and instead of waiting until the gunboat was immediately beneath them, had in their impatience let go their rocks, and they were falling harmlessly in the water ahead of the gunboat. Sydney steered as near the opposite shore as he dared, fearing that a boulder might have closed the channel. On top of the cliff the sound of strife could still be heard.Major Marble and Major Lukban anxiously questioned the prisoner. He alone knew the whereabouts of the trail which Espinosa and his men relied upon to furnish an avenue of escape in case the stronghold was successfully attacked. The Filipino officer held his revolver threateningly before the frightened native’s eyes.“If you allow us to pass it, I’ll have no mercy,” he exclaimed.The “Mindinao” had now emerged from[342] the dangerous cañon and the sound of firing above became less distinct.General Wilson was"
170,a,"was not sure.”Phil and Sydney exchanged glances and the captain looked up sharply, a faint suspicion entering his thoughts.[169]“What I’d like to know,” he added coldly, “is who was in that closed carriage; the sentry says there were four people.”Phil flushed as he read the insinuation in the captain’s voice.“Juan Rodriguez, his daughter and a Filipino overseer by the name of Lopez,” he answered promptly, but he lowered his eyes before the direct, searching gaze of the judge-advocate general. The presence of Colonel Martinez need not be told. It would but complicate the case and not aid in the search for Tillotson; but the army officer knew human nature too accurately, and Phil was too poor a hand at telling less than the truth.“There was besides a Filipino with the driver?” he questioned pointedly.Phil shook his head in the negative.“Was this Lopez within the carriage with Señor Rodriguez and his"
171,a,"and will try to catch you if you make a misstep—but they might fail,” he added with a shudder.A halt was called suddenly as they moved through a densely wooded section of the level trail, while several of Colonel Salas’ men moved cautiously ahead and appeared to work quietly in the jungle. After a few minutes they reappeared and signaled for the column to proceed.“Spring traps,” O’Neil informed the midshipman. “They’ve detached them from their springs. If we hadn’t known they were there one of us would have caught his foot in a piece of innocent looking vine which would have pulled a trigger and sent twenty or more spears across the trail with force sufficient to penetrate a pine board.”[287]Phil half wished that he had not volunteered for this nerve-racking ordeal. After all what did he owe Tillotson? Had not the army man tried to injure him in every"
172,a,"an agony of doubt, “don’t be foolhardy. We are absolutely in their power. See,” he cried desperately, “the ‘Albany’ has stopped and sheered away. She has given up the chase.”[56]Phil realized that Sydney was right—nothing could be gained by giving in to his rash anger. He saw that O’Neil had dropped the crowbar and had been led away by two of the natives, going as peacefully as a lamb. However his pride stood in the way of an outward surrender, and instead of agreeing to make no attempts to disable the steamer he arose and moved away from the tempting steering quadrant.The “Negros” had meanwhile threaded her way among the dangerous shoals and was now in the river; the cruiser had disappeared behind the land.A great crowd of natives ashore had witnessed the escape of the steamer from the war-ship and these lined the banks of the river shouting joyfully"
173,a,"news.“Tillotson’s father is keeping the wires hot,” he told them. “We are ordered to spare nothing to recapture him, but of course we shall do that anyway. The general has wired back the good news the señor has brought, that Tillotson is believed to be a prisoner and alive.”Before the party dispersed, Phil confided to his hearers his plan to explore the river and his intention to start that very night.“Then you will visit me on my ranch?” Rodriguez exclaimed gladly. “Everything I have is at your service,” he added with the grandiloquent air of a Spanish gentleman.[198]Phil nodded gratefully, realizing that unlike the Spaniard, whose form of address the native copied, Rodriguez made no empty offer.“I believe,” the lad continued, a spark of enthusiasm in his voice, “that a gunboat of the tonnage of this vessel is capable of reaching the insurgent stronghold.”“If you can accomplish that,” Major Marble"
174,a,"approaching. Phil halted his party and waited ready to attack if they turned out to be enemies. The next moment Maria had thrown herself into her father’s arms, and was sobbing hysterically, while his native followers withdrew to some distance and stood on guard in respectful silence.Phil and Sydney wrung the hand of their former captor Martinez.“What would Captain Blynn say now?” Phil exclaimed laughingly as O’Neil too squeezed the colonel’s hand until the latter winced. “He’d shoot us for traitors sure.”[163]Sydney smiled. “It would be rather difficult to explain the situation,” he replied, the drollness of the meeting suddenly striking him.“You saved my life, señor,” Rodriguez exclaimed suddenly, as Maria led him to the Americans. “My daughter has told me all. I do not know how she could have gone where she did, or how she found out that I had been summoned, but bringing you there has shown"
175,a,"of the natives approached his chief timidly, and spoke a few short sentences in a frightened voice.On hearing the man’s words, Salas’ face darkened in anger and he struck him brutally with his heavy whip. The startled native recoiled in terror from his incensed master.“He tells me that there is but one banka ready,” he explained apologetically; “the other bankas are at the foot of the trail two miles up the river. The ones we used this morning I left at the ranch. I am sorry, but as only five[218] can go in this boat some of the party must walk. Who shall it be?” he asked abruptly.“There are just five of us,” Maria suggested enthusiastically. “My brother and I are at home with a paddle and surely the señor colonel has often propelled his own boat.”Salas glanced keenly at the girl’s face. He saw nothing there save youthful eagerness"
176,a,"would arrive at their destination; but she belonged to a race whose color they had been taught to believe placed her on a social footing far beneath their own.The girl seemed to divine the hesitancy in the midshipmen’s manner, and for a second a slight flush spread over her dark cheeks.Phil was the first to recover and break the embarrassing silence, heartily ashamed of himself for his boorish manner.“We are glad, señorita,” he commenced haltingly in Spanish which had become rusty through lack of practice, “to have you use our chairs, and also,” he ended lamely, “to have you with us. I fear we are the only passengers.”A few moments later a servant announced[18] dinner, and the four took their seats at a table spread on the upper deck after the custom of the tropics.“The captain will not be with us,” the girl explained as Phil’s eyes rested inquiringly on"
177,a,"not wish you to believe,” the general[95] added hastily, “that I approve of useless bloodshed, but in a warfare such as has been forced upon us the higher instincts of generosity to a fallen foe have but small place. It is an eye for an eye with us now.”As the general finished speaking the adjutant-general, Major Marble, entered and greeted the newcomers warmly. Both the lads had known him in their Annapolis days.“Major Marble will give you the situation,” the general said as the midshipmen shook his hand in parting. “I suppose you are ready to get under way on summons.”Phil answered promptly in the affirmative.The major took the lads to his own comfortable quarters, facing the Plaza, and then told them briefly of the perplexing conditions under which the general was struggling.“The insurgents will only fight,” the major told them earnestly, “when they can surprise us, and with these"
178,a,"Colonel Martinez say to the girl. “Will you wait until your father sends for you, or will you accept an escort from me?”“I shall remain here,” she said; “the morning should bring my own people.”Shortly afterward the girl took her brother’s hand and led him away to the part of the camp that had been set aside for her own use, and Colonel Martinez joined the disconsolate Americans.“The señorita,” he said as he sat down on the ground near Phil, “has told me of the brave conduct of my prisoners, and I wish it were in my power to set you free. I have known many American navy men before this war began and my treatment by them has always been courteous and considerate. I have the power to take your parole, and knowing[65] the hardships which you must undergo as prisoners among our soldiers I advise you to give"
179,a,"the mouth of the river, a native canoe paddled rapidly from the landing, and ran up alongside of the gunboat. An excited hail came from its occupant, answered by an angry cry from Major Lukban who turned, his face deathly pale, and his hands trembling, to the midshipmen at his side.“Señorita Maria is missing,” he gasped.The midshipmen were stunned at the suddenness of this unexpected and disquieting news. Maria captured! What did it mean?Lukban declared that his first duty was to his young mistress and the lads heartily approved[351] of his desire to be landed to attempt to trail the lost girl and her brother.The excited native was brought on board from his canoe and told the eager men the meagre details of her loss.She and Juan had gone out to the cemetery in the morning, and had not returned. A search had been made in the afternoon and the"
180,a,"native would see the anxiety which he strove to hide.On the floor of the big room a cloth had been spread and a repast set out.With a graceful wave of his thin hands[214] Colonel Salas made a sign for all to be seated and took, himself, the place beside Maria. Phil sat on the other side of Maria, while Sydney and little Juan were placed opposite.Their brisk ride had given them all an appetite, but the terrible predicament in which they now found themselves had quite taken away their relish for food. The lads did their best to appear undisturbed, but any one with half an eye could have seen the restlessness behind their forced tranquillity.It is not the Filipino custom to talk while eating, and it was not until his dish was emptied that Colonel Salas broke the awkward silence.“Your English friends are very fond of adventure,” he said"
181,a,"see that marsh behind the town?” he exclaimed suddenly to Sydney whose eyes were upon the chart. “That’s probably mangrove, and they can’t get through that, so if they’re attacking, it’ll be from the side. If Tillotson lands his men to the northward and we take a position to the southward we ought to make a big haul. I told O’Neil to have the Colt gun ready and if it comes out as I hope it will, we’ll land it there,” pointing to a spot on the chart showing a low hill to the left of the town.Sydney agreed heartily with Phil’s plans, and berated soundly the attitude of the army man.“I suppose,” Phil said in apology for him as they parted, one to turn in, the other to keep watch until midnight, “that he’s had so much fighting he’s grown careless.”At midnight Phil was awakened, and relieved Sydney on"
182,a,"current for the search-light, and the Americans saw in the bright beam a motley crew of natives lining the lorcha’s rail, their eager bodies crouched ready to spring upon the deck of their helpless victim.“Tagalos,” the girl cried out in sudden alarm as she instinctively put her small brother behind her, shielding him from the flying bullets.“Don’t do it, sir,” O’Neil commanded hoarsely as Phil started precipitously forward.[23] “We can’t stand them off, we’re too few. Here we can make a stand if they attack us. We can’t save the ship.”The lads saw at once the wisdom in O’Neil’s advice. No power could save the ship from the terrible onslaught of that savage horde. The two vessels came together with a mighty crash, and the air was rent with harsh cries of triumph as the captors leaped on board, firing their guns and slashing with their sharp bolos. The cries"
183,a,"arose and left them without a word.“The rest of the garrison are returning, captain,” O’Neil announced, joining the midshipmen after his dinner with the soldiers. “You can see their dust down the beach.”[133]The lads watched with ill-concealed delight, much to Tillotson’s discomfiture, the arrival of Captain Baker and his eighty dust-covered soldiers. As they swung into the Plaza, apparently for the first time, they realized that something extraordinary had happened, for they quickened their pace and Captain Baker, unable to control his anxiety further, shouted eagerly to ask what had happened.Tillotson, assurance in his every motion, walked out to meet him.Phil could not refrain from comparing these two figures—one that of Captain Baker, alert, muscular, tanned by the sun, his uniform dirty and stained by travel, with grime on his soldierly countenance, while the other, slender, his clothes neat and of a dandified cut, seemed more in place in a"
184,a,"up in annoyed surprise. She saw her father on his knees in the corner before several heavy iron-bound chests, and their opened covers displayed to her anxious eyes a great wealth of gold and silver coins. More money than her young imagination had ever dreamed of.As Rodriguez’s eyes encountered the startled look in his daughter’s face, an expression of stern annoyance came into his own as he snapped the huge lids shut and rose to his feet.“Why do you keep all that money here?” she asked anxiously.Her father looked worried at the question.“All the money I have is in those chests, daughter,” he answered in a low voice. “It has[243] been buried, but when Garcia deserted me, Lopez and I dug it up and brought it in here. I fear these native banks, and if I should be robbed by the insurgents I would leave you and Juan penniless. My"
185,a,"his fluent and grandiloquent Spanish. “I have just seen the general. I abjectly apologize for my rudeness. May I count upon the friendship of the señores?” he asked in a suave, appealing voice.Phil flinched unconsciously. He felt as if some reptile was drawing him toward him against his will. Espinosa’s eyes were mild and his smile was urbane; yet he felt that treachery was hidden behind this mask of friendliness. Espinosa read the struggle in the lad’s eyes and for an instant the mildness died in his own and a savage gleam took its place, but Phil’s gaze had wandered, and this vision of the true man was lost.“I don’t bear you any ill will for that,” Phil replied, his voice unconsciously accenting the last word. “I suppose you felt you had been cheated of your victory over Colonel Martinez.” Then the lad stopped suddenly,[100] a question trembling on his"
186,a,"the hand, and thanked them for taking care of his two children.“It was the other way around,” Sydney cried in admiration. “Your daughter really saved us and herself, too. If it had not been for her we should have blundered into a fight with the ladrones and been killed for our pains.”The old man shook his head thoughtfully.“Salas, eh? So he is with Espinosa. The two blackest rogues we have in the islands. You are lucky to be free of them.”“How many men have you guarding your plantation?” Phil inquired, his mind bent upon the possibility of an attack.“I have five hundred men, but only three hundred rifles,” Rodriguez replied. “Captain Blynn will send sufficient guns to arm all the men by to-morrow. I do not fear an attack until after Espinosa is more recovered. My spies report that he is still suffering from his[236] wound. I suppose I must"
187,a,"over the island there came to Palilo to surrender to the general small bands of insurgent soldiers. Gregorio Rodriguez, the acknowledged leader after Espinosa’s death, had sent word to all his captains to stop fighting, and their obedience was instant.One evening somewhat over a week later, on board the “Mindinao” a dinner party was in progress. The happy general, a weight of care lifted from his shoulders, sat on Phil’s right, while about the board were the well-known faces of his friends. O’Neil, barred by naval etiquette from partaking at his captain’s table, in the shadow of the night, stood near, hanging on every word spoken. The[381] Chinese servants with smiling faces flitted between the galley and the quarter-deck.Maria sat between the two midshipmen, and the sadness in her eyes still lingered, but a look of admiration would kindle as she talked to each of her two friends in turn.General"
188,a,"wonder what it said?” But Phil’s mind was too much occupied in thinking of the chameleon character of his new friend to give more than a passing thought to the contents of the telegram.“How dared he accuse me of knowing about Tillotson’s disappearance?” Phil exclaimed as he sought unsuccessfully a solution to the mystery.“I don’t believe he really suspected us,” Sydney replied deprecatingly, “but it must have struck him as odd to say the least that you should pass an insurgent officer through the guards. You didn’t tell him why you did it or even give him any of the circumstances. I think it was natural that he should act as he did.”“I didn’t realize,” Phil said half laughing, “how queer it must have seemed to him. Well, I’m going up and make a clean breast of it.“Have you any suspicion as to the identity of the man I shot?”"
189,a,"the top and gone to the bottom of all the military offenses.”[137]Phil gasped in astonishment. Major Marble stood gazing compassionately at his young friend, apparently hoping to hear him clear up the mystery. But Phil was silent. He must have time to think.After Phil had reached his ship he scarcely remembered how he had behaved to his anxious and sympathetic friend, Major Marble. The boy’s mind was dazed. He had not believed that Tillotson would dare make charges against him, but now that they had been made, how should he act? The mere words of each charge were only too true but Phil felt that he had had strong and sufficient reasons for acting as he did. But now he must refute these charges or else go before a court-martial. But how could he refute them? There was but one way and that was to go to General Wilson and"
190,a,"that trail and not find out[67] that this band of natives had just left it. Where are all the old Indian fighters we used to have in the army?”Phil and Sydney both raised their heads, a look of surprise in their faces.“I hadn’t thought of that,” Sydney exclaimed. “Our trail must have been there; the native soldiers all go barefooted and leave but indistinct tracks on this hard soil, but our pony tracks must have been in plain sight.”“The solution is,” Phil broke in sadly, “those men were volunteers, the Seventy-eighth Infantry, the colonel said; there probably wasn’t an old soldier among them. They fight like demons when they see the enemy, but are as helpless as children against a savage foe skilled in woodcraft. If that had been a battalion of regulars there’d have been a fight and we would now be free, or,” he added with an unconscious"
191,a,"of smoke astern, but it gave them but scant encouragement, for it was only too evident that before the stranger, if it were one of the many small gunboats patrolling the islands, could hope to get within gunshot of the “Negros,” the steamer would have crossed the shallow bar of the Davao River and be safe from the pursuit of the deeper vessel.“If we could only stop her,” Phil lamented. “Smash those rickety engines or haul fires in the boiler.”O’Neil in answer cast a comprehensive glance at the sentries on guard on the upper deck. The evil-looking natives were squatted in plain sight, their loaded rifles held tightly in their brown fingers.[33]“Oh! for three good Krag rifles,” Sydney cried petulantly; “we could clear this deck and then jam the steering gear there, and by the time they could overpower us the gunboat, if it is one, would make them heave"
192,a,"of the steamer from the war-ship and these lined the banks of the river shouting joyfully as the “Negros” steamed quietly to the bamboo pier in front of the village.As soon as the dock had been reached, the girl dismissed the guards and the Americans once more gathered about the breakfast table.A few moments later Colonel Martinez, his face wreathed in smiles, left the bridge and joined them.[57]“You are to be given the freedom of the town,” he said as he took a cup of coffee from the servant’s hands and sipped it gratefully, “but I warn you if you attempt to escape you will be shot, and even if you escaped, without guides you would be lost in the jungle and be killed by ladrones.”Phil bowed his head in sign of submission. They were certainly prisoners, without hope of rescue.“To-morrow morning,” Colonel Martinez added, “we shall leave the village"
193,a,"meal.Phil shook his head.“No, there must be others, for I heard a woman’s voice in a cabin near ours.”As they again emerged on deck and walked aft to where their steamer chairs had been placed, a young Filipino girl rose from her seat and bowed courteously to the two young officers. Phil noticed as he saluted that she was a remarkably pretty girl of the higher class dressed in becoming native costume, and from her dark eyes there shone intelligence and knowledge.“Have I one of the señor’s chairs?” she asked in excellent Spanish. “It was very stupid of me to have forgotten mine.”Both lads remarked at once the air of good breeding and the pleasing voice; the guttural lisp so common in the Malay was lacking. She could not have appeared more at her ease and yet they saw by her dark skin and straight black hair that no other"
194,a,"life Espinosa had dodged the blow aimed at him and had taken flight, screaming as he ran for his men to open fire on the traitors. The shells of the gunboat seemed to fall in every part of the[329] stronghold and the havoc of their explosions was terrible to witness; but the small band under Lopez remained unharmed.Mad with fear, the natives who had been witnessing Phil’s torture, upon hearing the terrifying words of their leader and seeing the awful havoc behind them caused by the bursting shell, charged boldly on the natives in their front, believing that in that direction lay their one avenue of escape, but a well directed volley from Lopez’s men made them recoil in disorder.Like one who is chained, powerless in the grip of an unnerving nightmare, Phil felt rather than saw the wild scenes about him. He heard the sharp rattle of musket fire"
195,a,"upon the reporting of your relief, Midshipman Philip Perry, U. S. Navy, detached from the command of the U. S. S. ‘Mindinao’ and will proceed immediately to Manila, reporting your arrival, for passage to your home, to the senior officer present.”As soon as Marshall’s voice died away, Phil began to read his own orders, which he had kept safely pinned to the inside of his breast-pocket during the last few exciting days.“You are hereby detached from the U. S. S. ‘Phœnix’ and will proceed to Palilo, Island of Kapay, Philippine Islands, and upon your arrival assume command of the U. S. S. ‘Mindinao’ as the relief of Ensign Charles Marshall, U. S.

The Filipino officer held his revolver threateningly before the frightened native’s eyes.“If you allow us to pass it, I’ll have no mercy,” he exclaimed.The “Mindinao” had now emerged from[342] the dangerous cañon and the sound of firing above became less distinct.General Wilson was becoming impatient. He had held himself well in hand to steady the officers and men under him during the trial through which they had passed so successfully. Now his anxiety was more than he could keep to himself. He rushed up to the cringing native, taking him roughly by the shoulders and crying out to him in English, a language unintelligible to the terrified prisoner.But the general’s act was crowned with success. The insurgent soldier had steeled"

Here was the proud daughter of Rodriguez complimenting him. His small soul was nourished by the thought that he was feared by all.“Then, señorita,” he said, “if you do not consider me an ogre, will you and your English friends accept the offer of a share in my frugal meal? It is now ready inside.”The midshipmen had watched with beating hearts this plucky girl’s brave fence with the subtle native and as he pronounced the word English he glanced at the silent lads. Phil thought he saw a gleam of joy in his cruel eyes.“They do not speak Spanish?” he asked, shrugging his shoulder expressively as"

At a few paces from her he halted, and the Americans held their breath in wonder to see the bandit bow low before her, raising her hand to his lips. Then he turned and gave several harsh commands to his followers, who quietly dispersed.Inside of but a few minutes the lorcha had disappeared in the night and the “Negros” resumed its journey, the noisy engines chugging away just as faithfully under their new masters.[28]The Americans, as they gathered about the table to finish the meal long forgotten in the excitement of the attack, marveled at the outcome of the affair.“Who can she be?” Sydney whispered. “Why, she orders the ladrone leader around as if she were a princess.”Phil was about to reply when the girl herself appeared from the shadows, followed by the native chief.The lads regarded him with"

The soldiers by one accord had crowded aft, their rifles in hand and cartridge belts bulging with extra ammunition. Some had even filled the inside of their blue flannel shirt with more precious cartridges.[114]“Aren’t we going, sir?” the sergeant asked, gazing through the darkness for his lieutenant.Phil shook his head. He was too angry to speak."

Mention the dog's name and say ""board"" and to order him out, say ""move.""As soon as the dog gets in the boat say, ""Lie down"" or just ""down"" and if he does not obey, show him the whip and command him, then whip. As soon as he is down, get in and row a few hundred yards further and repeat the same a dozen of times. The moment the dog obeys, you must pet him so as to make him understand that what he does is right. If you will repeat the same tactics for three or four days, the dog will soon know how to balance himself and will be very steady — you will never have any bother with him.

In view of this fact it is quite likely that for general purposes and certainly for hunting purposes, a dash of alien blood is advantageous.The crossed collie, or the well-known shepherd dog, so common to the farm, are very often used with success in all forms of night hunting.

Unless a dog is not afraid of water, he will never make a good mink dog (or 'coon dog either for that matter), as mink go into a great many dens both on the bank and in the water.Where the hunting is done in woods, considerable distance from streams or ponds and mink seldom travel, your dog may ""pass them by"" but if you should catch one in a trap and let him kill it, the chances are that you will have a mink dog.Again by hunting certain stretches of creek where mink frequent, your dog will soon learn that you wish him to hunt these animals. A mink holed is far from caught, especially after night. If holed in the creek bank, the chances are that the animal will dart out into the water and escape to another den.The most successful mink hunting is done during"

First, endurance, because no dog can make a race after a red fox without it. Then speed, a good nose, lots of ambition, good sense and the more of that the better; and will need to be able to hear well to enable him to cut corners if he happens to get behind, as any dog is liable to do.After the pups are born, don't let the bitch run until they are weaned, for it will hurt both mother and puppies.

I said, Am, (that was Pard's given name, for short) I don't believe the dog wants to go with you any more than you want him to. Am's reply was that he guessed he would go all right if he wanted him.

I have given you this 'coon hunt as near as it happened as I can remember, but we had seven as good 'coon dogs as you generally run across.

They also get scraps from the table with some vegetables mixed with cooked rolled oats. I feed the old ones once a day with raw meat and once with porridge. I see that they get just enough to keep them always in good running condition, that is neither fat nor thin. I like a dog with a good rolling skin. I never take a skeleton dog in the woods as I have often seen hunters going deer hunting with dogs which you could read a newspaper through.Now of what use are such animals as these?

Now this is my idea of a good all around hunting dog. I don't expect you to find all of these qualifications in any one dog.Have decided that for my use, a full blooded hound.

He is a veritable trickster, compared with which the proverbial cunning fox must take a back seat. One of the 'coon's most common tricks employed to fool the hound is known among hunters as ""tapping the tree,"" and which he accomplishes in this way: When he hears the hound's first note baying on trail, he climbs up a large tree, runs to the furthest extremity of one of the largest branches and doubling himself up into a ball, leaps as far as possible out from the tree. This he repeats several times on different trees, then makes a long run, only to go thru the same performances in"

Now here is where the right kind of judgment must be used, as all dogs cannot be handled alike, and one may spoil a pup in trying to break him from rabbits. So taking everything into consideration, it is worth far more to train a dog for a first class 'coon dog than most people consider, — what it requires to train a dog, and what he should be worth when"
215,b,"are some strains of native hounds that train easier than others. Hounds that have come down through an ancestry which have long been in large packs have certain fixed notions or instincts about hunting that are more difficult to change than are hounds which have grown up singly or in couples.Whatever manner of hound the trainer may undertake to develop it is well for him to consider the dog's ancestry and the way in which they have been hunted. He will find if his hound is well bred that the ancestral influence will tend to assert itself. Knowing what is in his hound, the trainer will know better how to handle him to bring him up to the highest possible degree of efficiency.There were many different breeds of the hound family existing in England, when the fox hound, the great grandfather of the typical night hunter under consideration, began to"

And another thing I never do is whoop and hallo at my dogs when they are working. I think that has spoiled many a good dog, and never run to a dog as soon as he barks up, but give him time to think it over and circle the tree a few times; then, when he settles down again you can go to him and depend upon the 'coon being there.Different hunters have different ideas as to the style of dog best suited to their purposes. We can only approach the subject, by giving views of experienced breeders, and the reader may choose as he is inclined.From a Canadian Hunter comes the following:This question of the"

At once one or more will go to sawdust portion, — this done the ice is broken and henceforth all the dogs will use this part only as retiring place, leaving the remainder perfectly clean.Teach your hound not to be afraid of water, and to circle the tree and to keep an eye on the coon and to bark treed, but never allow him to get whipped by any coon at first as this will discourage him. Not only this, but the coon may blind him should he strike him in the eye.

This is a cut and dried operation that requires none of the resourceful tactics of man and dog in the chase, and is, therefore, dismissed from the discussion. Now, what are the dog's duties? The matter of still hunters vs. tonguers, being of such variance of opinion, it will be discussed in a subsequent and separate chapter.Having impressed your dog with the fact that you want him to look out for skunk, possum and mink, as well as 'coon, the next point of importance is to insist on the dog staying with the quarry and barking until you arrive; also not to take hold until the word is given as the hide is apt to be all chewed up and"

He has almost human intelligence, a pure bred collie can always be depended upon in sunshine or adversity. He can do his work in a manner that should put the average boy to shame. The pure bred Scotch Collies are of a kind and affectionate disposition and they become strongly attached to their master. There can be no friend more honest and enduring than the noble, willing and obedient thoroughbred Scotch Collie. As a devoted friend and faithful companion he has no equal in the canine race, he will guard the household and property day and night. The Scotch Collies are very watchful and always on the alert, while their intelligence is"
227,b,"quite stupid and very careless about hunting. They cannot keep on the trail, neither do they wish to run fast or continue running long. Old stinking pork seems to be the worst I could feed to a fox hound, and corn bread and some milk on it seems to be the best.When my dogs are fed on cornbread and milk they display the most activity, and can follow a fox or rabbit more accurately and accordingly run faster. When I want to make my hound run slow I feed him some meat, and the more it stinks the less he can smell anything but the fumes of this in his stomach. I can easily tell by the smell of my dog's breath whether he has eaten fresh mutton or rotten horse recently, and I think any healthy person can easily.Here are another hunter's views on this same subject:In rearing hounds,"
228,b,"they see the squirrel run back up the tree, you might as well kill them or take them and run deer, for they will never make tree dogs.The following directions for perfecting the rabbit dog, are from the pen of an experienced and successful Ohio hunter.Get your pup some day while young, if possible, keep him by you, and when you see a sparrow or something alive, shoot it, pick it up and show him what you shot at; do this at home. Shoot all you please while he is young, so when you go hunting with him and shoot at game he won't be afraid and make a bee line for home.Most dogs will soon take a liking to guns. Now to training a beagle dog to be a good one on rabbits, I warn you never to take another dog along, but for a common hound you may"

If the hound comes from hunting stock, he will hang to the trail with the other dog and he will only turn up with him but for some reason or another, should the young hound come back to you, ""don't get mad and kick or beat him."" No, this is a great error and many are the dogs which have been spoiled that way. Instead of beating, speak kindly to him and pet him a few seconds and keep moving towards where the chase is going.Don't excite your dog, pay no attention to him. If he wants"

I pulled away some loose rocks and could see the fox, and we soon had him out, and Pont seemed more pleased over the hunt than I was. There was scarcely a week that Pont did not help us out on the trap line.Not unfrequently did Pont show me a 'coon den. I had some difficulty in teaching Pont to let the porcupines alone, but after a time he learned that they were not the kind of game that he wanted, and he paid no more attention to them.I have had many different dogs on the trap line with me, and I can say to any one who can understand dog's language, has a liking for a dog and has a reasonable amount of patience and is willing to use it,"

Never take him out unless he is well fed, and in good shape to run. After a race or two let him go as soon as the trail is struck, and after a few races, catch the old dog, after the fox is going, and see what the pup will do alone. Then take them out on a good day, let the old dog pick up the trail, and after the pups have started, catch the old dog and let the pups go alone, and if they trail, start and run"

Thus is enlisted the training of centuries to match the wits of the 'coon which was born wily, and develops stratagem from experience and necessity, affording as exciting and pretty a contest (dog vs. coon) as sport provides.The more one knows of the hound he follows, the greater will be his enjoyment and success.

They seek the warmest spots they can find, a rope coil, rag or paper, or even a tin can to lie on, in preference to ice or hard snow. Failing in this, they will dig a hole in the soft snow and bury themselves in this, lying one on top of the other in bitter weather.

If it is a 'coon or opossum, then put up a tree or on a fence. Loose your dog and let him trail until he finds it.

Then when you come home you may give him the rabbit heads. Let him in the house, and when you eat your rabbit, give him all the bones. This will teach him why and for what you take your game home. One great thing is, if your dog scares up game and is following on the trail, don't change your standing place too often; judge the point where the game will come around and stay there until it does come.Some fellows will run, jump and halloo after his dog while running a rabbit; there is where you spoil him, for you must be cool in mind.

We tried to get one of the dogs to pull him out but the 'coon got first hold every time, so we got a stick and dug in a little ways. We could then see Mr. 'Coon's eyes down in the hole.

Fishes, birds, rabbits, nuts, acorns, berries and green corn are the principal dishes on the 'coon family's bill of fare.At first the little 'coons stay close to their mother's heels, but they grow more venturesome as they grow older, and soon begin to make little journeys on their own account. This often proves their undoing when dogs are about. Any sort of an old dog can tree or catch on the ground a baby 'coon, but this is an advantage no true sportsman will knowingly take.That a mother 'coon will even brave death herself to save her babies is evident to one who has studied the habits of the 'coon.

I don't care how much noise he makes if he is fast. I like a good tonguer. I only have four hounds at this writing. I have caught 27 'coon and 10 opossum. On the night of November 9th, some friends of mine went out 'coon hunting with me. They had three 'coon dogs and I had four, seven hounds in all. We went about two miles south of where I live to where we sometimes hunt the 'coon. The first thing when we got there the dogs struck a trail and treed on top of a hill with an old coal entry just below it.We got up to the tree all right and could hear one of"

Now in my experience, I have used nearly all kinds of 'coon dogs, some good ones and some not so good. I think the difference is in the kind of country to be hunted, for hunting in a very rough country that is cut up by long hollows and large tracts of timber I prefer a tongueing dog.For hunting in this locality where it is all cut up into small fields with principally all rail fences and timber in small blocks, mostly cut over by lumbermen and nothing left but hollow"

In that way, after telling him to go to heel whenever he tries to run away, he will understand the word better when he goes with you to drive the cattle for the first time.Let him keep back of the stock with you, while you drive the cattle to and from the field or pasture without undertaking to teach him, for as he learns by observation, he must have the example made plain.

It is well worth while.Some trappers will take issue in regard to the advantages and disadvantages of the dog on the trap line. The subject holds sufficient interest, however, to warrant a chapter, and if some lonesome trappers benefit thereby, our effort shall stand justified.Now, we will say first that there is as much or more difference in the man who handles the dog as there is in the different breeds of dogs. We have heard men say that they wanted no dog on the trap line with them, and that they didn't believe that any one who did want a dog on the trap line knew but very little about trapping at the best.Now those are the views"

Sometimes they break down and have to drag their hind parts (sled fashion.)A remedy that I have never known to fail yet for that is: Lard and spirits of turpentine about equal parts mixed and bathe in well across the kidneys and also across the back of head where it joins to neck. Usually two or three applications makes a cure.Perhaps no more mooted question enters in for so widely separated opinion as the comparative superiority of the Still Trailing dog and the Tonguers.The still or mute trailer is the deer, rabbit or night dog which does not give tongue on the trail. He keeps his silence, until his game is treed or in sight and about to tree.The tonguer"

I run fox myself sometimes, or my hounds do rather.Now I see some of the hunters like a still trailer, but I want to hear my dogs work and I want to know which way they are going, and when they begin to get away I can follow and keep in hearing of my dogs. I can tell by their baying just about what they are doing, if the trail is cold or warm, and can tell which way they are going. I wouldn't give a cent to hunt with dogs that couldn't make a little music when on the trail.I see some of the brothers think nothing but a"

They may be bred almost any way and yet be good coon dogs but I find it is just as necessary to have them bred from coon hunting stock as for any dog or animal to be trained for any specific or especial purpose. It must be bred with that object in view and as much of that blood and disposition injected into the veins as is possible to get.The fox hound is a special or specific type or breed of dog.

I pity the dog that is unfortunate enough to have such an owner.My experience is that too much meat is not good for the foxhound, and if they get a mess of old stale meat just before you want to run them, the chances are that they can't make the race.

There are times when he kills one that he cannot get out, owing to a short bend or other obstruction in the hole.

The ugly, little Irish terrier is sometimes used to good advantage for crossing, where heedless, reckless pluck is sought. These dogs are very game, yet remarkably good tempered with man.

Never let him get whipped by another dog or woodchuck, 'coon or even a big rat. Always help him kill or whip everything he jumps on to or that jumps on to him.

His contention is, no doubt, that the pup should not be permitted to over exert himself or to be thrown too much on his own resources.All the foregoing has more or less application to the present topic. We are still dealing with the nocturnal wanderers. Occasionally any of the above may be discovered abroad in the full glare of day. Some hunters successfully locate them, by the aid of dogs, in their dens or burrows and capture them in the day-time. This is a cut and dried operation that requires none of the resourceful tactics of man and dog in the chase, and is, therefore, dismissed from the discussion. Now, what are the dog's duties?

The way to get your pup away from a den is to look the situation over and then give up, telling him to give it up; we can't get it; he will soon come away.There are other things to be careful of; first you should never hurry your dog; walk slow and when"

These dogs have generally a special gait, which they keep steady whether the trail is cold or hot, and give the full cry the whole time, and also often come to a full stop to blast away a few louder roars. These dogs dwell too long on the scent for me. My strain of dogs will open only when they are on a hot scent; if cold, they will cover the ground silently and fast.A swift dog cannot keep up the full cry, but will give a roar now and then and not bark often as it takes a lot of wind to roar. Therefore, a dog cannot be a flyer and a roarer in the meantime, and a deer, fox, lynx or 'coon, chased by a fleet and silent dog as above mentioned, will have to point at once"

The best coon dog I ever had (and I've had a good many) was a half Scotch terrier and I don't know what the other half was. He was black and white spotted with curly hair and weighed but thirty-two pounds.Some hunters prefer the shepherd dog and again some would hunt with nothing else but a hound. I don't know as it makes much difference what kind of a dog one uses, just so it is one of the hunting kind, a good trailer and thoroughly well trained. Of course, not every dog, even of the hunting kind, will make a good coon dog; about the only way to tell is to try.As to picking a pup for a coon hound, it is very hard to do, but I want a full bloodhound, one"

About the water, the water spaniel is well adapted. For instance some spaniel blood in a mink dog is well worth considering.All of the spaniels, readily develop into retrievers, and this is their principal use at present, although they can be taught to hunt with considerable effect and judgment, where too much is not expected of them.

And so it goes.The hound is the master orator, with a command of language that varies from uncertainty, joy, anxiety, conviction, eagerness with great clearness and truth. His shades of meaning are accurately intonated and perfectly comprehendible to the well versed hunter.The hound is looked upon with disdain by people who know not his capabilities, and is considered in the nature of the dunce of the tribe. Well do the well informed know that he is the most delicately strung and the most highly emotional type we have.Every note that he utters is an expression of emotion. Because emotion is more susceptible to music than any other agency, his code of expression is likened unto notes of music, and with more fidelity than some instrumental sound producers committed in the name of music.A student of this pure and undefiled language says:"

In the morning when we were ready to go Am tried to have Pont follow him, but it was no go, Pont would not go with him. Then Am put a rope on to him and tried to lead him, but Pont would sulk and would not be led. Then Am lost his temper and wanted to break Pont's neck again.

The dogs hit another trail and went south about a mile and barked but not treed. We went to them and they had run this 'coon into a shallow hole in the corn field. We tried to get one of the dogs to pull him out but the 'coon got first hold every time, so we got a stick and dug in a little ways. We could then see Mr. 'Coon's eyes down in the hole.

Should you let him go meeting the old dog he may take the back track, but if you wait until the old dog has passed your pup, he will come in behind, and, if he"

Therefore, it is advisable to buy the best obtainable for even though the price be high at first cost, the hunter will be better satisfied for his time and money when the dog has fully developed for the chase.

However, their success is, in a general way, in proportion to their adaptability for the work and the plentifulness of game. For instance, take a country raised dog of hound parentage, and he is as apt to make as good a night dog as a pedigreed, handsome hound which has grown up in the city, without opportunity to verify by experience his instinctive notion of things.

There is always a worthless bitch, and sometimes several of them to be had for nothing, and some fellow who wants a dog but don't want to pay a fair price says, ""I'll get that bitch and breed her to that dog down at Graysville.

Then as soon as they are born, put them in a clean, dry place, where they will be comfortable, — if in winter, where cold winds cannot reach them; if in summer, in a cool place out of the hot sun. Feed the bitch well on good food of different varieties; do not chain her, but rather shut her up in a park of something of the kind, where she can exercise but not get out to run, for if she should run she gets hot and you may loose some if not all of your puppies.By the time the pups are three weeks old, you will need to commence"

Then if he will only run a short distance after starting the wolf and come back and hunt the pups, and then bark at them when found, you have a good, valuable dog.

Consequently in breeding for coon dogs, this is the most important point. Get as many other coon points as you can, but be sure his ancestors have been good tree dogs, as far back as you can trace them.The very reason that there are so many culls in this country, is because many hunters think a dog is a dog, and that any dog with long ears is a hound.

When you have a coon or two, take one at a time to an open field about 400 yards from the bush, then tie a long clothes line to the ring of the chain in such a way that it will not slip off. At the other end of the line, tie something white, and allow Mr. 'Coon to make for the bush. Have a friend with you that will keep"

If the den has more than one entrance, is not very deep in the ground, the animal will often run out by stamping or striking a few licks with a mattock. The mink generally comes out at the entrance nearest the water (quite often under water) when it can be shot, if you are quick enough, or if the dog is an active one, caught.When hunting at night along streams, or places frequented by both mink and 'coon, it is sometimes difficult to tell, at first, which your dog is after. These two animals travel about the same along streams. Some dogs will not run mink unless especially trained while others take naturally to mink hunting.

Well, any hunter of experience in the handling of hounds is fully aware that it is not always the dog which carries the prizes at the shows that is the best dog in the field.

I believe what I have told will generally break any dog.A good dog, well broken to hunt 'coon, skunk or opossum is worth scores of traps. Don't be afraid to switch a young dog some, to make him learn good from bad, like tonguing track and rabbit.

Otherwise, the start is a steady pull until well under way. A good team double will pull easily a load of 1,000 pounds or more, single about one-half, depending largely on condition of themselves and the road they travel.

As a consequence he lacks the speed of his English brethren, and for this reason he is not a desirable field trial candidate, but as a steady, reliable dog, with more than average bird finding ability, he will always have a number of admirers.""The Irish setter is another interesting one of the setter family.

I think a hound will do more running and keep in better order on that mush with meat than any food you can give them.

As a rule, existing difficulties or arguments in harness are stored up until that day's march is over, because of fear of punishment from the driver, but as soon as turned loose, they settle the difficulty of the day by another scrap, in which often one bunch will participate in, ""take sides,"" and chew up each other, until all pitch in, aiming to settle things somehow.

Never give them more than what they can eat, and in the meantime see that they just get enough so as to clean the dish well at every meal and in no case should the pan containing the food be left in the intervals with the puppies if they have not cleaned it out as they will become disgusted with it and next time refuse to feed."

But if one is so constituted that he must give his dog a growl or a kick every time he comes in reach, and perhaps only give his dog half enough to eat and cannot treat a dog as a friend, then I say, leave the dog off the trap line.Not a hunting dog in a strict sense of the word, yet most important in that connection, is the sledge"

For that reason fox chasing is fast losing its interest and foxes are becoming quite a nuisance in the destruction of quail, pheasant, rabbit and such like game.A brother of conviction on this question writes: It takes patience,"

After a race or two let him go as soon as the trail is struck, and after a few races, catch the old dog, after the fox is going, and see what the pup will do alone. Then take them out on a good day, let the old dog pick up the trail, and after the pups have started, catch the old dog and let the pups go alone, and if they trail, start and run that fox to a finish, that is all the pedigree they will ever need.When you turn your dog loose, don't run and yell and get him so excited that"

Never set your dog on stock of any kind nor allow him to run after other dogs or house-cats.By the time he is four months old, he will likely begin to run rabbits, but some do not commence until older.

If you have a fox or coon hide to drag or a pet to lead, it will not do any harm, though I do not think it of much value as they soon learn to associate your tracks with those of the fox or coon, and I greatly prefer letting them run rabbits as a mode of"

Yet, if the pangs of hunger gnaw one's vitals, repugnance, position in life, creed, superstition, opinions, likes and dislikes, self-respect, all give way to the cravings of an empty stomach; especially in that trackless great white desert called the ""Distant Polar Regions.""Such is the life and existence of these, the sledge dogs of the north.Those who make a science of breeding and training fox hounds, and indulge in the chase for sport only, have a nearly identical standard of the ideal the country over.

I wouldn't give a cent to hunt with dogs that couldn't make a little music when on the trail.I see some of the brothers think nothing but a still trailer catches his 'coon on the ground. If you have fast trailers they will catch 'coon on the ground if they tongue every other jump. My dogs are all good tonguers and I often have them catch 'coon on the ground and big 'coon, not little young 'coon any more than old ones. A young 'coon will take to a tree quicker than an old one. I have got to see my first well bred 'coon hound that will still trail. I have never seen him yet, that is, a fox hound. I have tried shepherd and hound cross, bull dog and hound cross, and beagle and fox hound cross, but give me the pure bred fox hound every"

You may have to make several trips, but after you get one race, your dog will be looking for a fox chase, and will soon take a cold fox trail in preference to a rabbit.After you have trained your dog to running foxes or coon, you will wish to break him of running rabbits; this is generally an easy matter, for a genuine dog prefers the fox or coon and some will quit it of their own accord. If not, try scolding him when he starts a rabbit. If that fails, whip him, but where foxes are plentiful, you will seldom have to do this.My"

The fox hound requires, I think, more exercise than any other breed of dogs. I have a 25 gallon caldron. I put most any kind of meat that I can get, beef, horse flesh, 'coon, when there is one that is pretty badly bruised up, pork or any kind of meat that is not decomposed, and put it into this caldron.

At times when worked hard, they get off feed, so to speak, sulk and refuse to come up to a drag. In which case the remaining dogs must do the work and rarely do they fail to whine, show their contempt for such action and punish ""His Nibs"" at the first chance later on, even pining to get at him, sled and all, as they observe him following behind alone.On hard pulls, or uneven drags, they play out easily, act mulish, refusing to budge until the sled is started or at variance"
328,b,"The skunk and opossum are common to many sections of this country. They are less resourceful and gritty than the 'coon, and their taking is simply a matter of choice and method, rather than concern for opportunities. A dog trained to hunt 'coon will have no trouble attending to opossum and skunk, if his owner desires it. Very frequently the trainer does not desire that his dog pay attention to anything save 'coon.Still another profitable animal taken by night hunters is the mink. There is not so much sport in this branch, however, as the dogs simply trail or locate them in their dens, and are captured by digging or frightening them out, when they are dispatched by the dogs.A good mink dog will often locate a mink in the den during the day. If the den has more than one entrance, is not very deep in the ground, the"

Occasionally any of the above may be discovered abroad in the full glare of day. Some hunters successfully locate them, by the aid of dogs, in their dens or burrows and capture them in the day-time. This is a cut and dried operation that requires none of the resourceful tactics of man and dog in the chase, and is, therefore, dismissed from the discussion. Now, what are the dog's duties? The matter of still hunters vs. tonguers, being of such variance of opinion, it will be discussed in a subsequent and separate chapter.Having impressed your dog with the fact that you want him to look out for skunk, possum and mink, as well as 'coon, the next point"

If you get it in your eyes, it feels about as if you had horse-radish or hot water in them for the next ten minutes, which is not altogether pleasant.""The skunk is a foolish, unresourceful animal and were it not for its natural, unique means of defense, would be utterly at the mercy of dogs and hunters. Many dogs object to the scent and will trail and bring to bay a skunk only with reluctance. Only those who hunt for profit, care to take the skunk, and he must needs"

A hound coming from such selected stock will learn and pick up in a day what will take others months and probably a whole season to learn. I never kept a hound which after having shown him the game and also blooded him once or twice would not at once start to hunt because I consider that the sooner a sportsman will shoot such dogs the better.There are plenty of fox dogs that are good coon dogs, and a great many coon dogs will run a fox to a finish, but the fox and coon dogs are two very different dogs. There is also a greater difference in the opinions of hunters, in regard to the coon dog than in any other dogs.Some want the full blooded hound, and some a cross with"

They will then lie down for a long time and walk around and howl until they find somebody's trail, which they will follow to the end or until they land at a settler's house or at some shanty and will remain there.Now how many dogs like these will a party of ten or twelve men require to hunt, during ten or fifteen days in a strange country? When a hound has been away three or four days, is he in condition to run the next day after his return? No, it will take him as many days to recover and often he will be of no use for the remainder of the hunt.Dogs like these"

Well do the well informed know that he is the most delicately strung and the most highly emotional type we have.Every note that he utters is an expression of emotion. Because emotion is more susceptible to music than any other agency, his code of expression is likened unto notes of music, and with more fidelity than some instrumental sound producers committed in the name of music.A student of this pure and undefiled language says: ""Each note represents a particular feeling, and the whole harmoniously blended, tells a simple story in a pleasing way.""Now the hound"

Where are all of the 'coons going to stay when you get all of the den trees cut down? I want to ask you where is the land owner that wants 'coon hunters cutting his timber down? Think of cutting a fine, large tree down because it has a hole in it with a 'coon inside. If I get a 'coon in such a tree and can't climb it, I just call the dogs away from the tree and let him go until some other time.

All you have to do is to take your gun and dog into a field and once there to tie your dog say five or six feet from you, then to shoot the gun and after every shot to speak kindly to your dog and make him smell the gun. In a day or so repeat as before and the moment you see that your dog is not afraid let him loose and shoot again and always pet him. He will then know what a gun is.

One has to have good parent hounds, and while the mother dog is carrying the pups she must be worked on whatever you want your pups to run. For instance, we have a black and tan long eared bitch, bred her to a good hound, one quarter stag. Before she had these puppies we caught three bears with others, letting her get in and fight hard.These puppies when a month old would crawl on a bear hide rug, chew and shake at it, and when three months old, would track, bark and fight. Now they are five months old and know considerable about it.

In deer hunting, it has many advantages in so far, that when you are several miles from camp, after your dog has a start you keep moving and if you find where a deer has just passed, you can just sit there and wait for the return of the dog and as soon as he returns, you just tie him and allow him to rest for"

As a rule, existing difficulties or arguments in harness are stored up until that day's march is over, because of fear of punishment from the driver, but as soon as turned loose, they settle the difficulty of the day by another scrap, in which often one bunch will participate in, ""take sides,"" and chew up each other, until all pitch in, aiming to settle things somehow.

The same would exist if the dog was first trained on the fox.Some people claim that it takes from three to five years to train a hound right. Well, this is not always the case. Young hounds twelve to fifteen months old are often taken from the city into the bush and in three days would hunt deer as well as other dogs of five and six years' training. The reason for this is that these dogs take as naturally to hunting as ducks do to water.

When the pup is five or six months old, teach him to speak or bark by holding up a piece of meat or bread, and when you get him so he will bark, take him into the woods where there are squirrels. Be sure and take your gun along and chase every squirrel or cat up a tree and shoot the squirrel. Be sure and make the dog help to chase the squirrel then skin the squirrel. Cut it up in small pieces and feed it to your dog. Do this as often as possible and you will be surprised how quickly he will learn. Commence early in the fall to hunt 'coon,"

As for a quitter, in my opinion a vast majority of them have never commenced, not because they had a ""yellow streak,"" as most hunters say, but because like the Irishman's pig, they have too many streaks of lean. As your dog is a better friend to you than most people of the J.

But if after ten, or twenty minutes, he should again return, treat him as before. Be always kind to him. If you have no old dog to train your young one, go with your dog and show him the game you want him to hunt, lead him until you kill one, then blood him. The blooding is the ""A, B, C"" of training.

No, a dog with just the skin and bones cannot stand any work for the reason that he has no bottom.Young pups should be fed at the very least three times daily, four times is still better.

In such places a slower dog is required as well as one that willingly hunts close to the shooter.For work in open fields or over prairie land, the setter is perhaps better suited, because he, as a rule, ""has greater speed, wider range, greater endurance and staying qualities. If retrieving from water came into play, the setter also would have the preference."

Now I do not wish to criticize any of my brother sportsmen, but I think it is the only way to know if one's dog is well bred, and to have a well bred dog means much less trouble in training him.

The latter start the game when the grey hound goes forward and effects a capture, or so interferes with progress, that the other dogs come up and finish the work.A bit of practical talk on the subject from the pen of a grey hound enthusiast is appended:I have always had grey hounds. If they are let run with the track hounds when they are young they soon learn to take a track, run away from the pack and catch the game. I have some one-half grey hound and one-half bloodhound or fox hound. No better dogs living. Great fighters, stay as long as the game runs. This kind are good bear dogs.

I put most any kind of meat that I can get, beef, horse flesh, 'coon, when there is one that is pretty badly bruised up, pork or any kind of meat that is not decomposed, and put it into this caldron. Of course, I put water in first then put in my meat and boil until it will all stir off the bone. I then take all the bones out and stir in corn meal until I have enough so that when the meal is done it will be a very stiff mush. When it is done and cooled off you can take it out in chunks.

Anything below this should be debarred from competition.

Well, they will require a car-load and besides several men to hunt the dogs. Such dogs as these don't stay with me, as I consider them a nuisance, especially for city sportsmen, who are so busy during the whole year that they can only take a few weeks holiday every year, they require a strain of hounds on which they can depend every day of their hunt.

To tell something of night hunting, and especially to suggest how the ever necessary dog can best be selected, trained, maintained and utilized, is the consideration of first importance. To round out the subject all forms of hunting will receive some notice, and the various breeds of dogs will be so far dealt with, that their value and usefulness in their given fields may be determined. Best of all, the contents of this volume are based on the opinions and declarations of men who have had years of experience in the matters on which they presume to write. The Compiler does not assume authorship, the matter herein being very largely from articles which have appeared in Hunter-Trader-Trapper and elsewhere. Credit"

The airedale are great water dogs and very hard workers and easily trained to hunt any kind of game. They are full of grit and they fear nothing and are always ready to obey your command. I have hunted with them and found this breed of dog away ahead of the water spaniel, collie, etc. Once you own one you will never be without it.""The Airedales were first imported into this country in 1897 or 1898, from England, and as companion and guard dogs, as well as hunters and retrievers have made wonderful strides, and are becoming more popular as"

Get a thick, hard, round-footed, long ears coming out of head low down, well developed chest, shortish tail, large at root or next to body, long from hip to gamble joint, with broad strong back, wide nostrils and long pendant lip. Now this is my idea of a good all around hunting dog. I don't expect you to find all of these qualifications in any one dog.Have decided that for my use, a full blooded hound. That is a good, fast and reliable trailer, one that will stay with the trail, cold or hot, and never think of giving up until asked to. One that will bark treed on a cold trail just the same as if he had run him up a sight chase. One that should he in cold trailing run across a"

But whatever you do, don't let the animal get the best of your young dog or you will have a spoiled dog. I always liked a possum for this work because they are easy to handle and don't fight your dog.You must remember that, at this point, you are not training your dog to fight. The object is first to find where the animal goes and second to get your dog to ""bark up."" Continue this practice for some time; then put your animal in a larger tree out of sight but don't put in the same tree each time, After you have your"

Labored respiration, constipation or obstinate diarrhoea, usually the latter, which frequently runs into inflammation of the bowels.In some cases many of the above symptoms will be absent, the bowels being the first parts attacked. The following, which sometimes, but not necessarily, occur with distemper, I classify as complications, viz.: Fits, Chorea, Paralysis, Pneumonia or Bronco-Pneumonia, Jaundice, and Inflammation of the Bowels, and will require treatment independent of any one remedy that may be given.TREATMENT — The animal should be placed in warm, dry quarters, and hygienic conditions strictly observed. With puppies, at the start give vermifuge, as nearly all have worms which add greatly to the irritation of stomach, bowels and nervous system.The bedding should be changed daily and the apartment disinfected twice a week.Feed frequently on easily digested, nutritious diet, such as beef tea or mutton broth, thickened with rice. Let all food"

In deer hunting, it has many advantages in so far, that when you are several miles from camp, after your dog has a start you keep moving and if you find where a deer has just passed, you can just sit there and wait for the return of the dog and as soon as he returns, you just tie him and allow him to rest for fifteen or twenty minutes and then you start him again. I have often had two and sometimes four chases in one forenoon and this without bother. Hounds thus trained, will always return to camp every night for their feed and will be ready for the next day.Some hunters say that their dogs are so good that when they turn them loose, they always stay away for three or four days and they even go so far"

The question is to train them. Hounds which come from untrained or from partly or badly trained stock will always be poor hunters. They will never be the dogs that they would have been had they come from highly trained stock, that is that their sire and dam and grand sire and grand dam were all trained by persons who thoroughly understood the way of breeding and rearing as well as the age and proper way of training. A hound coming from such selected stock will learn and pick up in a day what will take others months and probably a whole season to learn. I never kept a hound which after"

After two or three days lessons such as these, the dog will take the water. To make him do this, row a few yards from the shore and call him. He will at once follow you. Row slowly away and the moment you see he is getting tired, pull him on board or row to shore. Never train your dog to swim during cold weather but when it is warm and sunny. A nice sunny morning is the best time to teach them to swim. Once he knows how to swim right, take him across a small river or lake and then come back and make him swim back. He will then never be afraid of water.To teach a hound"
380,b,"hound to be a fine ranger does not require many years of training if he comes from a sire and dam that were both good rangers and which their own sire and dam and grand sire and grand dam were all good and highly trained dogs. He is sure to hang from them and any sportsman having dogs of that strain will enjoy the use of his dog at once, but where it takes three or five seasons and sometimes more to make a good dog, is when they come from exhibition stock or from stock that have never been broken right. If a hound is wrongly taught to hunt he will always be a crazy dog and will, if bred, give poor hunters exactly like himself.An Ohio Fox Hunter goes on record thus: In breeding hounds some seem to expect great work on any line they wish to see"

The mink generally comes out at the entrance nearest the water (quite often under water) when it can be shot, if you are quick enough, or if the dog is an active one, caught.When hunting at night along streams, or places frequented by both mink and 'coon, it is sometimes difficult to tell, at first, which your dog is after. These two animals travel about the same along streams. Some dogs will not run mink unless especially trained while others take naturally to mink hunting. Unless a dog is not afraid of water, he will never make a good mink dog (or 'coon dog either for that matter), as mink go into"

The best cure for mange that I have ever used, or for sores to heal them is black gun powder, powdered sulphur and lard, mixed and well rubbed in. It is a sure cure for mange. It will soon kill the germs, if properly applied.I notice where a brother, in telling how to break a young dog to tree 'Coon said, to let the 'coon chew the dog for a while, help the 'coon, let him eat the dog for about 20 minutes and the dog would go to hunting them to get revenge, or something to"

When treed he changes his bark, so that usually the hunter can distinguish between the signals.We shall withhold personal opinion as to the preferable style, and present the arguments of a number of adherents on both sides of the question, allowing the reader to come to his own conclusion.A West Virginia 'coon expert says, in favor of the tonguer: I have had several good 'coon dogs, both tonguers and silent trailers. This is a hilly, brushy country, with lots of deep hollows. The best 'coon dog I ever had was a three-fourths fox hound, one-fourth bull dog. He was very fast with a good nose and a wide hunter. He never struck a cold trail and went straight ahead all the time."

Add to the drinking water lime water in the proportion of one to thirty.By following this treatment as laid down, many cases of eczema will disappear. Some probably, may be accelerated by the use of a skin lotion in conjunction. Eczema in these cases is merely a symptom appearing in evidence of disordered digestion. Indigestion may be considered as a mild form of gastritis, which if not corrected, will be followed by true gastritis, the stomach then being in such condition that"
385,b,"one should remember that they will always have a hobby for the first game they learn to hunt; therefore, we should be careful to start them first at the right kind as for instance: If you desire to have an all around hound that will hunt coon, fox and rabbit and to hunt each game well, and in order to succeed you must break him in on coon first, then when he knows the ""A, B, C,"" of Mr. Coon, you can break him on foxes and then on rabbits in the day time and when you will hunt coon he will pay no attention to the fox or rabbit even if he would see one in front of him, providing there are coons in that bush.If you desire to have a true deer hound, train him first on deer, then on foxes, but you must in all cases train"
386,b,"of scent and this is very important as you do not have to travel so much ground to find a trail that he can run. What we want when we go after 'coon is to start and catch all we can. If we cannot start one we cannot catch him, sure. I have followed behind over the same ground with my hound that another party had been over with their still trailers and caught more 'coon than they.And again if you are out on a windy night and your still trailer gets a 'coon treed to the windward of you, you might as well go home as there will be no more fun for you if he is a good tree dog.Now just one thing more in regard to still trailers catching 'coon on the ground. That has not been my experience, for you all know when you go a"
387,b,"woods without the slightest idea where he was and that is no fun when you have gone three or four miles walk from home to get a 'coon chase.Another brother puts it this way: Some hunters prefer a still trailer on a cold trail. I have handled both kinds but it is an advantage to the hunter in keeping in touch with his hound if the hound will ""wind his horn"" occasionally on a cold trail for very often a wide hound will travel a couple of miles on a cold trail before starting the game. In windy weather, the hunters might be at a loss to know in which direction his dog was working, if he did not hear him. I like a dog with a loud, clear voice and one that keeps the music going steady once the game is afoot.Still another gives voice to his sentiment thus:"
388,b,"good luck is had he is very likely to be the next man to propose another ""'coon hunt.""A half dozen hunts will make an enthusiastic 'coon hunter of any able bodied man — and I might suggest that a half a thousand 'coon hunts will make an able bodied man out of any man. It will throw off the waste matter and dead tissues of the body, cause deep breathing, arouse torpid and sluggish livers, promote digestion, and is a general panacea for all human ailments of both mind and body.(The foregoing contains much of value but is overdrawn even tho from the pen of a ""Southern Gentleman"" who should be well versed in 'coon hunting. Now and then a 'coon will go up a tree and come down or even run out on a limb and jump off or may leap from a log across a stream into the"

The latter start the game when the grey hound goes forward and effects a capture, or so interferes with progress, that the other dogs come up and finish the work.A bit of practical talk on the subject from the pen of a grey hound enthusiast is appended:I have always had grey hounds. If they are let run with the track hounds when they are young they soon learn to take a track, run away from the pack and catch the game. I have some one-half grey hound and one-half bloodhound or fox hound. No better"
390,b,"wants a collie and another just a dog. Then here is a hunter who insists on a silent dog; and the next one says the silent trailer doesn't camp with him.Now as I am not looking for trouble, I will agree with all of you. Where coons are plentiful and you are likely to strike a coon track in every cornfield, the half hound or even a cur dog, will get coons; but where they are scarce and you may tramp until near morning, and then strike a trail five or six hours old, if you get that coon, you will need a dog with a good nose and one that tongues on a trail. But there is one point on which you will all agree — if your dog does not stay at a tree and bark good and plenty, he isn't much of a coon dog. Consequently in"

Purists, however, insist on keeping them pure and undefiled.In appearance the pointer is larger than the setter, and gives one an impression of solidity and strength; his coat should be soft and mellow, but not absolutely silky. The hair is short and straight.The setter's coat should be long, straight and silky (a slight wave is admissible) which should be the case with the breeches and fore legs, which, nearly down to the feet, should be well feathered. The color may be either white and black, white and orange, white and lemon, white and liver, or black, white and tan; those without heavy patches on the body, but flecked all over, called Belton, preferred.There is, as in most other questions of hunting and shooting experiences, wide difference of opinion as"
392,b,"of eight months, the breeder himself will have difficulty in choosing any one as the best.There is a standard for judging the so-called high class pedigree show dogs but which does not cut much ice with a fox and coon hunter. Regardless of color, the qualities most desirable in an all around fox hound are: 1st, staying qualities and powers of endurance. 2d, voice, feet and general make up.Personally, I like a hound that stands from 20 to 24 inches at shoulder, long in body, deep chested, heavy boned with a coat of rather long hair, the feet should be round in shape with a good covering of hair to protect the soles or pads. A foxhound should not have a second claw on the hind leg for this shows a cross in his breeding. A dog that has these claws will not stand much hard running in crust for"

The dogs were working a trail and they were puzzled on it; did not seem able to get away. There were a black oak and hazel bush where we were then, so we sat down to let the dogs work it out if they could. We were sitting within 10 feet of an oak tree, the lone dog came up, circles the tree and barks up, then three of the other dogs come up and start to bark. One of the boys says there might be a 'coon up that tree but I doubt it. Well, I said, when four good 'coon dogs bark up a tree at the same time, there is liable to be something up there, so up went one"
394,b,"Proper care and sanitary lodgings will reduce the danger, but sickness will occasionally occur, no matter how great the precautions.Dog owners should therefore acquaint themselves with the commoner forms of ailment to which dogs are subject and thus be in a position to quickly administer such relief as is possible, thereby frequently stopping a sick spell promptly that might otherwise result seriously if not fatally.The dog is very similar to man in his ailments as well as in his susceptibility to drugs. As a general thing medicine that is good for a human being is good for a dog under similar circumstances. ""While no definite rule can be laid down"" says an eminent authority, ""it may be said that a dose suitable for an adult person is correct for the largest dogs, such as St. Bernards; for dogs from forty to fifty pounds the dose should correspond with that given"

The largest 'coon I ever caught weighed 30 pounds. He measured from the tip of his tail to the end of his nose, 4 feet and 4 inches. I caught another one last winter that weighed 25 pounds and measured four feet and 2 inches from his nose to the end of his tail.I catch a good many that weigh over 20 pounds. Another thing I want to tell you is this, in over 20 years of 'coon hunting I have never cut a tree down to get a 'coon. There is too much of that kind of work done. Where are all of the 'coons going to stay when you get all of the"

Any hound trained when young can be taught to trail man or beast.Hunters differ as to the kind of dog to use for coon hunting. The best coon dog I ever had (and I've had a good many) was a half Scotch terrier and I don't know what the other half was. He was black and white spotted with curly hair and weighed but thirty-two pounds.Some hunters prefer the shepherd dog and again some would hunt with nothing else but a hound. I don't know as it makes much difference what kind of a dog one uses, just so it is one of the hunting kind, a good trailer and thoroughly well trained. Of course, not every dog, even"
397,b,"have neither snow nor trained dog, you will have more trouble, but I have made No. 1 dogs without either.If you know where foxes stay, go there, turn your dog loose, and he will start to running rabbits; this will scare the fox up and your dog will likely cross its track; if he is a born fox dog, he will leave the rabbit for the fox every time. You may have to make several trips, but after you get one race, your dog will be looking for a fox chase, and will soon take a cold fox trail in preference to a rabbit.After you have trained your dog to running foxes or coon, you will wish to break him of running rabbits; this is generally an easy matter, for a genuine dog prefers the fox or coon and some will quit it of their own accord. If not, try"
398,b,"miles more to reach our camp when I came to a place where a deer had just left his nest, so I thought that I could get a shot at him but after having followed him for about an hour, I gave him up and I tried to make for camp.Well, instead of making for camp, I made a circle and came back to the same place where I had left the deer's track. It was 4 P. M., when my dogs came back to me. I knew then that I was completely turned so I decided to spend the night right there. I looked for a sheltered place and after removing all the snow I could I lay down with my back against a big flat stone and with my two dogs lying near me. We were quite comfortable and early in the morning, I pointed for camp. Now"

Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his stores. On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to"

About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding 104 them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain"

After sending to inquire my character at the house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same rate, 3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she 48 said, from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's daughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband, whose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the times of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her"

With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America. Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, 129 to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid any thing to that of Britain. We were to"
409,c,"and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humor, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men 148 constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that they had done every thing, and there was nothing further to employ them about, ""Oh,"" says he, ""Make them scour the anchor."" This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings."
410,c,"our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, ""He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."" And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings. In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a"
411,c,"to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey. We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of"
412,c,"beasts and half devils. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street. And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of Westminster Hall; and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both house and ground were vested in"
413,c,"bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price. In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing 64 the partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our discredit. These two friends were William"
414,c,"general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary. I happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, ""Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it."" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons; and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and"
415,c,"the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and"
416,c,"only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented us. Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry; to find more than fifty"
417,c,"now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political manœuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning. It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,"
418,c,"to him, or advanc'd for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, as he was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found myself relieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting a little money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's to work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater 46 printing-house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London. At my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd to in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing. I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands."
419,c,"presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June. In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general 130 purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then appeared that several"
420,c,"great influence with his son, had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd might break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd to print 56 some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few words, the effect"
421,c,"being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch, we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work. This gave me occasion to observe, that,"
422,c,"of vice; and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors. This is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business, occasion'd my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise; tho' I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the"

In 1748 he sold his business in order to get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the learned throughout Europe. In 4 politics he proved very able both as an administrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an office-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance his relatives. His most notable service in home politics was his reform of the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his services in connection with the relations of the Colonies with Great"
424,c,"it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way. From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain them in descending; but 100 certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth, whether, since many"
425,c,"into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and left me to serve some customer. I was surprized to find these were not the governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend Denham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith's character; told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the smallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way of my business. ""Among the printers here,"" said he, ""you will improve yourself, and when you return to America, you will set"
426,c,"not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose. ""It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them. ""I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back counties have"
427,c,"scholars remov'd into the building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both. The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia. I have been"
428,c,"for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases. This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect"
429,c,"been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual 116 or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from."" This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as"
430,c,"always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in travelling, where"
431,c,"demonstrated will be the propriety of every man's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world. Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life. Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment, instead of being tormented with foolish 75 impatience or regrets. Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often the characteristic. Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which he considered as a"
432,c,"father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that had got a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me to marry her, 23 and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly. So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or knowledge of any person in the place, and with very little money in my pocket. My"
433,c,"having experience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life? ""Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated fantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good.

They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who went to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's curiosities. In our return, at the request of the company, whose curiosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river, and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfryar's, performing on the way many feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and pleas'd those to whom they were novelties. I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied and practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of my own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All these I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much flatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of becoming a master, grew"
435,c,"and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated. Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain. In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir, etc., etc., It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too busy till now to think of"
436,c,"the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to 22 let it be printed for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under my name for several months. At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I took upon me to assert"
437,c,"as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade,"
438,c,"in favor of the project, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at last gave a flat denial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the 32 patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive. My friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office, pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to go thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, he set out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to come with mine and me to New York,"
439,c,"notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for 7 three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of"
440,c,"in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.

Your account of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only in point of character, but of private history) will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness. As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same"
442,c,"correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd poor Miss Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided company. 69 I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this"
443,c,"facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny. Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation. In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, 153 who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments. They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr."
444,c,"was translated into German, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association, and it would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd. It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or 112"
445,c,"to, made me many compliments, desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made myself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd. I went, however, with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my business, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence in procuring the public business of both governments. On my doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he would give me a letter to him, in which he"
446,c,"reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment. As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being"
447,c,"uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method. In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning. These"

But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employ'd in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was thought as good as any man's.

This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humor, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men 148 constantly at work; and,"

At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of"

But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which"

Some people came down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as to understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not understand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and night coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if we could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he.

Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his stores. On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way"

Ralph read plays to her in the evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he followed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out of business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them 45 with her child, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country school, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts. This, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future better fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was"

Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4.

They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the Legislator of the Colonies."" I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being 167 once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to"

George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice. I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in"

The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broad side, to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants. In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication. I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating instruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd"

At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevail'd with them to chuse me. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abated, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of both setts of trustees, that for the building and that for the Academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep for ever open in"

He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it never was. At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore"

These I gave him from time to time, but endeavor'd rather to discourage his proceeding. One of Young's Satires was then just published. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of advancement by them.

It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast. In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers.

464,c,"Collins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer. Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising. Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a prettier talker. Both of them great admirers of poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasant walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what we read. Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many faults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius for poetry, and advis'd him to"
465,c,"his sect, except Monsieur B———, of Paris, his élève and immediate disciple. What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag'd the public attention every where. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity. Dr. Wright, an English physician,"

I too was taken up and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them any satisfaction, they content'd themselves with admonishing me, and dismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound to keep his master's secrets. During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal, notwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my brother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libelling and satyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the House (a very odd one), that ""James Franklin should no longer print the paper called the"

469,c,"of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with"

Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion. The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly, express'd his approbation of the plan, ""as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention.""

Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as possible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all"

The physical book also included the Journal of John Woolman and Fruits of Solitude by William Penn. This document only contains the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. A scanned version of the physical book owned by the Library of Congress is available through Hathitrust. Scores of different editions of Franklin's Autobiography exist.

An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants. Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy. The first step I took was to associate in"
475,c,"to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to 160 call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. ""So, you are soon return'd, Innis?"" ""Returned! no, I am not gone yet."" ""How so?"" ""I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready."" ""Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire."" ""Yes,"" says Innis, ""but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on."" This observation"
476,c,"suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected. With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of 110 the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline for"
477,c,"Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June. In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general 130 purposes. As we pass'd thro'"
478,c,"and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or 112 heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him. ""I approve,"" says I, ""of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries."" I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of"
479,c,"often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's, called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life. This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of my"
480,c,"be with him some time on liking. But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father, I was taken home again. From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read"
481,c,"your raw American militia, but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression."" I 141 was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general"

The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money. ""The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's"

This was the second governor who had done me the honor to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like me, was very pleasing. We proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money, without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collins wished to be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he had some recommendations, he met with no success in any application, and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at my expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in business. At length he had got"
484,c,"bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of being introduc'd among the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp's bill was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. 54 He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree. John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something daily. We never worked on Saturday, that being"
485,c,"for nonconformity holding conventicles in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church. Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My"
486,c,"governor prevail'd with me to take charge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts. In order to march thither, I"

On his return to America he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair, through which he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was again despatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to petition the King to resume the government from the hands of the proprietors. In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but lost the credit for this and much of his popularity through his securing for a friend the office of stamp agent in America. Even his effective work in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him still a suspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for the Colonies as the troubles thickened toward the crisis of"

On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left"
489,c,"goods; I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a little time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will,"

He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them. They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that, if I were to 51 remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get a good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place."
492,c,"Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, ""No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly."" ""My dear friend,"" says he, pleasantly, ""how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them."" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, 132 therefore,"

But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd. In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this"

A man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little. Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I met a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to, in Second-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread, I"

This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political"

I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief done me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter, etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed to the chappel ghost, which they 47 said ever haunted those not regularly admitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself oblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually. I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable influence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappel [4] laws,"
497,c,"I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted. The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the project; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible. On this I form'd"
498,c,"by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks dry. The Indians are dextrous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd inform'd that his and"
499,c,"my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right owner. This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu'd as"
500,c,"been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for the bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water. At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the province. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a friend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv'd by reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses, introduced me to their friends, and show'd"
501,c,"the two young women, which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said: ""Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them."" As I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as she did, she mentioned some things she had observ'd and heard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she was right. I thank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow it. When we arriv'd"
502,c,"seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves. After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable. We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them. I did so soon"
503,c,"without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collins wished to be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he had some recommendations, he met with no success in any application, and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at my expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in business. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to think what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it. His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd; for, when a little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the Delaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. ""I will be row'd"
504,c,"horses was generally known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me. Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me with a subscription"
505,c,"and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the Quakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labor and want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till the meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was, therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia. Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and, accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. ""Here,"" says he, ""is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better."" He brought"
506,c,"a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business 11 he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc. I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my father declared against it; however, living near"
507,c,"them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair was by my means compleated. My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with the success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship. The British government, not chusing to permit"
508,c,"himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and"
509,c,"acquaint his friends what was become of him. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree. John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something daily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor œconomist. He, however, kindly made no demand of it. Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder in America; I had seen types cast at James's"
510,c,"human nature and 73 society. But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features of private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic. The two works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable! Influence upon the"
511,c,"then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better. It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all"
512,c,"I had his directions what to remit it in. Accordingly, he gave me an order. This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness. At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New 33 York, among which were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible, matron-like Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her I suppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said: ""Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all"
513,c,"we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention 39 by agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the time of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had done nothing. He then show'd me his piece for my opinion, and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit. ""Now,"" says he, ""Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He is not so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece, and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and so produce nothing. We shall then see what he"
514,c,"on the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people. A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were"
515,c,"an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception 92 and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right. And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual"
516,c,"call'd upon by Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some years after. I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from Boston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food, and on this occasion consider'd, with my master Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, ""If you"
517,c,"her attendants. I had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her I suppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said: ""Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them."" As I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as"
518,c,"firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, ""At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses."" Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument; but I who was intimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favour 107 ought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides,"
519,c,"far as to improve one's language, but no farther. On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As language and expression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention 39 by agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the time of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had done nothing.

We shall then see what he will say to it."" It was agreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appear in my own hand. We met; Watson's performance was"
521,c,"inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning. These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:83 My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the"
522,c,"said Friends were all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were against 113 the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing. While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of"
523,c,"of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on every thing in my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamper'd with. On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came"
524,c,"life. In 1748 he sold his business in order to get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the learned throughout Europe. In 4 politics he proved very able both as an administrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an office-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance his relatives. His most notable service in home politics was his reform of the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his services in connection with the relations of the Colonies with Great Britain, and later with France. In 1757 he was sent to England to protest against the influence of the Penns in the government of the colony, and for five years he remained there, striving to enlighten the people and the ministry of"
525,c,"another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner unexpected. [3] One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up, censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I suppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I"
526,c,"dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc. I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my father declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early projecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted. There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge"
527,c,"ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders. To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great"

It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy. 114 Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, ""I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was"
529,c,"water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away."" I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some 128 streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up above three"
530,c,"and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence. About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding 104 them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order,"
531,c,"military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more"
532,c,"being on horseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation. The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow with"
533,c,"return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's letter recommending me to my father. In the mean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the governor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great honor I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and friendly manner imaginable. About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in 31 going down the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and"
534,c,"town's people that had a good will for him, enter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking and prospects; while Bradford, not discovering that he was the other printer's father, on Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on by artful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all his views, what interests he reli'd on, and in what manner he intended to proceed. I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradford left me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was. Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English which he was then using himself, composing an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned, an"
535,c,"a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often, take my advice. We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by re-enforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I"
536,c,"I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking. I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce"
537,c,"considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the 96 means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright. These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending"
538,c,"being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited. The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk. The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing"
539,c,"in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance. He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and, tho' I call'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. ""And you,"" says he, ""when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately."" I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as"
540,c,"Thus this important affair was by my means compleated. My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with the success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship. The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but"
541,c,"hands, tho' none good, and seem'd to have a great deal of business. Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a little time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what his"

This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the collector's"
543,c,"of the plan, ""as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention."" The House, however, by the management of a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification. In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, ""No; you may, on the contrary, have a very"
544,c,"seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrived after they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money. It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard to translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abbé Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd and publish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his"
545,c,"arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employ'd in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was thought as good as any man's. [15] The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown, resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to 158 England,"
546,c,"had the overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place. Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I work'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive; a great sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding, for he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv'd my fortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read"
547,c,"about me. My unexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however, very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see him at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again. The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a country it was, and how I lik'd it. I prais'd it much, the happy life I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it; and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a handful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of raree-show they had not"
548,c,"not readily meeting with any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he had agreed with at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a shilling every three months, as they would deserve by improving in 53 their business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor t'other. John ———, a wild Irishman,"
549,c,"and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business 11 he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc. I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my father declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and when in"

As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of every man's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world. Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life. Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment, instead of being tormented"
551,c,"we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharff. Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest. I think"
552,c,"and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers were engag'd in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods! but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly. Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a paquet from Governor Denny for the General. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters"
553,c,"were wretched ones; and, if I would set up there, he made no 30 doubt I should succeed; for his part, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other service in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I being at work together near the window, we saw the governor and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, and heard them at the door. Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension of politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments, desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made myself known to him when I"
554,c,"of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being ""for the king's use,"" and never to inquire how it was applied. But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited"
555,c,"me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time. Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice, and accordingly, expected the same services from me as he would from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our disputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner unexpected. [3] One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political"

My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon, ""Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men,"" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened; for I have 80 stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner. We have an English proverb that says, ""He that would thrive, must ask his wife."" It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old"
557,c,"it credit and made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their conversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were received with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in as usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity."
558,c,"beyond which the quantity may be hurtful. I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the Newcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it; small things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and these, to me, were really great advantages, as they were great encouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and votes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as I follow'd the business. I now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose."

I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by"
560,c,"with the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find, on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way. From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain them"

My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer. They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and"
562,c,"took another lodging, and he followed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out of business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them 45 with her child, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country school, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts. This, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future better fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each per"

The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this"

I also engrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a factotum. But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master, frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an outbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience, thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening near the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see"

And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.

Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the 32 patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.

If you will take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands."" I agreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing the best account that had been given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick. As soon as he was"

I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose. I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought"

And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul"

They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediately comply with their proposal. ""Why the d—l!"" says one of them, ""you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?"" ""I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty."" I gave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared.

""I see,"" says he, ""you have improv'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain.""

For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.

It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the light-house was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of light-houses, and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America, if I should live to return there. In the morning it was"

Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many faults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he was bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he might, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to employment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account. I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and then, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther. On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting,"

But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted answering the message. When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd"

When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing. While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight"

Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and, accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. ""Here,"" says he, ""is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better."" He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a dinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I might be some runaway.

We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water. At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the province. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed.

The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, can not come up in time to support each other.""

In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of my father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years old. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year. In a little time I made great proficiency in the 15 business, and became a useful hand to my brother. I now had access to"

Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the 32 patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.

The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as 89 it was, without farther grinding. ""No,"" said the smith, ""turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled."" ""Yes,"" said the man, ""but I think I like a speckled ax best."" And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad"

I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I picked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd in London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith. ""I don't know such a 42 person,"" says he; but, opening the letter, ""O! this is from Riddlesden.

A number of us, however, are yet 79 living; but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.

After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable."

There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking"

Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry; to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this"

The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good.

Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases.

At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well"

I will therefore begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those 78 who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and"
592,c,"the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church. Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New"

[T]hose who know Franklin only in his Autobiography, charming as that classic production is, have made but an imperfect acquaintance with the range, the vitality, the vigor of this admirable craftsman who chose a style ""smooth, clear, and short,"" and made it serve every purpose of his versatile and beneficent mind. This version of the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was part of The Harvard Classics edition published by G. P. Putnam & Sons in 1909.

When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back.

I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it. Considering your great age, the 76 caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.

General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me. Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to"

And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war Both stood prepared, when through the multitude Advancing at their fellow-warrior’s call,640 The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce Prevented. Awed at once by their approach Hector retired, with whom Æneas went Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,645 Fierce as the God of war Automedon Stripp’d off, and thus exulted o’er the slain. My soul some portion of her grief resigns Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse, For"

The Pelian ash Started right through the buckler, and it rang. Æneas crouch’d terrified, and his shield Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam Bursting both borders of the ample disk,345 Glanced o’er his back, and plunged into the soil. He ’scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood, With horror infinite the weapon saw Planted so near him. Then, Achilles"

Ye need not, fellow-warriors, to be taught That now, as ever, the immortal Gods980 Honor on seniority bestow. Ajax is elder, yet not much, than I. But Laertiades was born in times Long past, a chief coëval with our sires, Not young, but vigorous; and of the Greeks,985 Achilles may alone with him contend. So saying, the merit of superior speed To Peleus’ son he gave, who thus replied. Antilochus! thy praise of me shall prove Nor vain nor unproductive to thyself,990 For the half-talent doubled shall be thine. He spake, and, doubling it, the talent placed Whole in his hand. He glad the gift received. Achilles, then Sarpedon’s arms produced, Stripp’d from him by Patroclus, his long spear,995 Helmet and shield, which in the midst he placed. He stood erect, and to the Greeks"

Fire! Bring me fire! Stand fast and shout to heaven!

Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats At her approach forsaking, with full cups105 Her coming hail’d; heedless of all beside, She took the cup from blooming Themis’ hand, For she first flew to welcome her, and thus In accents wing’d of her return inquired.

Therefore enough— Too long like children we have stood, the time Consuming here, while battle roars around.305 Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks A hundred oars should sink beneath the load. The tongue of man is voluble, hath words For every theme, nor wants wide field and long,310 And as he speaks so shall he hear again. But we—why should we wrangle, and with taunts Assail each other, as the practice is Of women, who with heart-devouring strife On fire, start forth into the public way315 To mock each other, uttering, as"

High towering Telamonian Ajax yields390 To no mere mortal by the common gift Sustain’d of Ceres, and whose flesh the spear Can penetrate, or rocky fragment bruise; In standing fight Ajax would not retire Even before that breaker of the ranks395 Achilles, although far less swift than he. But turn we to the left, that we may learn At once, if glorious death, or life be ours. Then, rapid as the God of war, his course Meriones toward the left began,400 As he enjoin’d. Soon as the Trojans saw Idomeneus advancing like a flame, And his"

Oh spare us! son of Atreus, and accept Ransom immense. Antimachus our sire Is rich in various treasure, gold and brass, And temper’d steel, and, hearing the report160 That in Achaia’s fleet his sons survive, He will requite thee with a glorious price. So they, with tears and gentle terms"

But come—consult we on the sum of all,70 If counsel yet may profit. As for you, Ye shall have exhortation none from me To seek the fight; the wounded have excuse. Whom Agamemnon answer’d, King of men.

Then Hector, leaping with a dreadful shout From his resplendent chariot, grasp’d a stone, And rush’d on Teucer, vengeance in his heart.370 Teucer had newly fitted to the nerve An arrow keen selected from the rest, And warlike Hector, while he stood the cord Retracting, smote him with that rugged rock Just where the key-bone interposed divides375 The neck and bosom, a most mortal part. It snapp’d the bow-string, and with numbing force Struck dead his hand; low on his knees he dropp’d, And from his opening grasp let fall the bow. Then not unmindful of a brother fallen380 Was Ajax, but, advancing rapid, stalk’d Around him, and his broad shield interposed, Till brave Alaster and Mecisteus, son Of Echius, friends of Teucer, from the earth Upraised and bore him groaning to the fleet.385 And now again fresh force Olympian Jove Gave to the Trojans;"

Haste, therefore, to the fleet,835 Inform Achilles; bid him haste to save, If save he can, the body of his friend; He can no more, for Hector hath his arms. He ceased. Antilochus with horror heard Those tidings; mute long time he stood, his eyes840 Swam tearful, and his voice, sonorous erst, Found utterance none. Yet even so distress’d, He not the more neglected the command Of Menelaus. Setting forth to run, He gave his armor to his noble friend845 Laodocus, who thither turn’d his steeds, And weeping as he went, on rapid feet Sped to Achilles with that tale of wo. Nor could the noble Menelaus stay To give the weary Pylian band, bereft850 Of their beloved Antilochus, his aid, But leaving them to Thrasymedes’ care, He flew to Menœtiades again, And the Ajaces, thus, instant bespake. He goes. I have dispatch’d"

Then had not many a Grecian, lifeless now,70 Clench’d with his teeth the ground, victim, alas! Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued To Hector and his host, while ours have cause For long remembrance of our mutual strife. But evils past let pass, yielding perforce75 To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease Now; I resign it; it hath burn’d too long. Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight, That I may learn meeting them in the field, If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet80 To watch us this night also. But I judge That driven by my spear to rapid flight, They shall escape with weary limbs[5] at least. He ended, and the Grecians brazen-greaved Rejoiced that Peleus’ mighty son had cast85"

To which may be added, that if the providence of heavenly powers to their creatures is expressed by the love of a mother to her child, if men in regard to them are but as sleeping infants, and the dangers that seem so great to us, as easily warded off as the simile implies, the conception appears sublime, however insignificant the image may at first seem in regard to a hero.From this we learn that the Lydians and Carians were famous for their skill in dying purple, and that their women excelled in works of ivory; and also that there were certain ornaments that only kings and princes were privileged to wear.This speech of Agamemnon over his wounded brother, is full of"

That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege.[The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.—Tr.]The character of Thersites is admirably sketched.

Brave as I boast myself, I feel the task500 Arduous, through the breach made by myself To win a passage to the ships, alone. Follow me all—Most laborers, most dispatch.[4] So he; at whose sharp reprimand abash’d The embattled host to closer conflict moved,505 Obedient to their counsellor and King. On the other side the Greeks within the wall Made firm the phalanx, seeing urgent need; Nor could the valiant Lycians through the breach Admittance to the Grecian fleet obtain,510 Nor since they first approach’d it, had the Greeks With all their efforts, thrust the Lycians back.

But she, (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass’d, And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned265 Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear In accents, as of pity, thus address’d. Ah brother! thou art overtask’d, around The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven; But stand, that we may chase him in his turn.[12]270 To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied. Deiphobus! of all my father’s sons Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved Thee most, but more than ever love thee now, Who hast not fear’d, seeing me, for my sake275 To quit the town, where others rest content.

But enter thou,585 Embrace his knees, and by his father both And by his Goddess mother sue to him, And by his son, that his whole heart may melt. So Hermes spake, and to the skies again Ascended. Then leap’d Priam to the ground,590 Leaving Idæus; he, the mules and steeds Watch’d, while the ancient King into the tent Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove.

But Teucer still another shaft produced Design’d for valiant Hector, whose exploits (Had that shaft reach’d him) at the ships of Greece560 Had ceased for ever. But the eye of Jove, Guardian of Hector’s life, slept not; he took From Telamonian Te5cer that renown, And while he stood straining the twisted nerve Against the Trojan, snapp’d it. Devious flew565 The steel-charged[11] arrow, and he dropp’d his bow. Then shuddering, to his brother thus he spake. Ah!"

The pauses in Homer’s verse are so frequent and various, that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has left us. He frequently pauses at the first word of the line, when it consists of three or more syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one only. In this practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface to the first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse without rhyme can neglect with impunity.Similar to this is"

The sailors beckoned them to the ships to trade.Queerly enough, the women brought with them a baby or little guanaco, which they led by a string. Our historian learned that when these giants wished to capture the old guanacos or camels they fastened one of the little guanacos to a bush, and the old ones came to the bush to play with it, and so became an easy prey.""Six days afterward, our people going to cut wood,"" writes the Knight, ""saw another giant, who raised his hands toward Heaven.""When the"

These one thousand and more sea gardens, some eleven thousand miles from New York, number about as few islands of importance as there are American States.

But silence, silence! [42] I saw it with my own eyes, but we must be still. It was the King himself!""The alcalde dared not accuse the King, and yet he must save his own head.

So there were shadows in the sunlands.We can fancy Pigafetta relating his discoveries on the shore to a susceptible spirit, like Del Cano, and writing an account of them day by day in his immortal journal.These strange adventures by sea and on land which so greatly interested the Italian Knight Pigafetta, our historian, do not seem to have greatly impressed the mind of Magellan.

The leader of this expedition, Miguel de Legaspi, caused his men to marry native women, hoping thereby more easily to subdue a wild and untrained race.In 1571 this colonizer brought Manila under his influence, and induced the native King to accept the suzerainty of the Spanish King. He proclaimed Manila the seat of Government, and made it an episcopal city.Legaspi came to learn a very strange thing. It was that the Chinese had made themselves masters of navigation by monsoons. They came down from their coasts to Manila Bay on northwest monsoons, and when the monsoons changed they were"

The poetical Italian tells the story in this way:""During these storms, the body of St. Anseline appeared to us several times.""One night among others he came when it was very dark on account of bad weather.

This purpose more and more absorbed his soul—he himself was nothing, discovery was everything. The frown of Portugal no longer cast any deep shadow over his life; it was his mission to find. He heard in the acclaim of Columbus a prophecy of what his own name would one day be.[15]All things follow suggestion and inspiration, and the discovery of the Western World owes much to the heart and brain of Prince Henry, called the Navigator.

The philosophy of this latter treatment was interesting—blood did not remain with pain, and pain departed with blood—quite true; white people have advanced theories as conclusive.""When one of them dies,"" says our Knight, ""ten devils appear and dance around the dead man.""

The transition from these ideal scenes to what is to follow is sudden indeed.[139]Magellan, as we have shown, had sought not wealth, nor glory, but the good of the world in his life.

Charles was mapping Europe; his fire of ambition was glowing, and the news of the new fields of the ocean that these discoveries had brought to him filled him with pride and exultation.He resolved on giving Del Cano and his mariners a splendid reception, after the manner that Isabella had received Columbus.Del Cano was now the living representative of Magellan. In publicly receiving him with heralds, music, and festival he would do honor to Magellan, [178] whose name"

The native had gone into the wood and had put a cord about the neck of the great serpent and attached it to the horns of a buffalo, and the buffalo was dragging the python toward the bungalow. The python was seven meters long (thirty-nine inches to a meter), a distended mass of folds and flesh (page 356, Alfred Marché's Luzon).What had he swallowed? What creature was there inside of him that was about to be digested, and that so distorted his folds?The serpent was harmless in the noose and from the weight of his meal.The traveler severed the python's vertebræ, rendering it inoffensive, and then made an incision into its abdomen.A surprise followed. Out of the abdomen came a calf of some months' growth. The animal's legs were so doubled under its body as to make the latter horizontal. The serpent was prepared for the museum of"

A fleet of one hundred and thirty vessels prepared to bear the bride to her handsome Prince. The ships were under the command of the chivalrous admiral of Castile.Juana took leave of her mother at the end of August, 1496, and embarked at the port of Laredo. A more interesting bride under more joyous circumstances had seldom gone forth to meet a bridegroom.The sails covered the sea under the flags of the glory of Spain. They drifted away amid music and shoutings, but the salvos of the guns had hardly died away before terrible storms arose. The fleet was shattered, and many of the vessels were lost.The young bride herself arrived in Flanders safely, and her marriage with the archduke followed at Lille.When Queen Isabella heard"

He said:""His cousin, Mesquita, our captain, advised these crimes, and so we put him in irons, and have brought him back to receive justice in Spain.""Mesquita protested his innocence and tried to gain credence for his case. But no one cared to listen to him. The court and the popular feeling were against him. He was consigned to a prison. It was useless for him to protest, and to say that Magellan had made a great discovery; that he had found straits which were leading to the South Sea, and which were [101] likely to prove that the ocean that Balboa had beheld was continuous.He was placed in a lonely dungeon, and there brooded over his wrongs and dreamed.He had one hope; it"

He showed the letter to the King's ministers.He thought that the point of South America turned westward, as the Cape of Good Hope toward the East. He had an imaginary map in his mind of [25] an ocean world whose shape had no real existence, but that answered well as a theory.Magellan had brought a globe from Portugal on which he had drawn the undiscovered world as he thought it existed. The strait which he had hoped to find was omitted on this globe in his drawings that no navigator might anticipate his discovery.Some of the ministers listened to the project with indifference, a few with ridicule; but as a rule Magellan appealed to willing ears. The"

The people were looking to the heavens for mercy day by day. But the copper sun rose as often in a clear sky.At last Magellan's sails appeared in the burning air. The sight of the sails was followed by that of clouds.The people thought that the fleet had brought the clouds with them.""They come from Heaven,"" said they of the adventurers.So when they were exhorted to accept Christianity, they at once fell down before the uplifted crosses and believed the teachings of the sea heroes who could command the clouds and bring rain to the parched land.They thought the ships were gods and the small boats the children of such beings, and when"

That day of discovery was Portugal's glory. [22][23]Calicat was a merchant city of the East, and one of the most famous of India. Here came Arabian and Egyptian merchants. It was a Mohammedan city, and the princes of Calicat encouraged trade between the Arabs and Hindoos. The city was now to become an emporium for the Western World.After many adventures in Malabar, Vasco da Gama cruised along the coast of India. Everything was wonderful, and the wonders grew.In September, 1499, he returned, and was received like a sovereign by the Portuguese King. His arrival was a holiday, the glory of which has lived in all Portuguese holidays until now.He was given titles of distinction. He was made a"

He is the South American camel.This giant when he made himself ready to meet the adventurers had shoes of leather or skins, and carried a bow made of the ""gut of a beast"" and a bundle of cane arrows feathered, at the end of which were small white stones.""The Captain caused food and drink to be given to him.""Then the crew began to show him some of the presents they had brought, among them a looking-glass."" [82]When the giant saw himself in the glass he was filled with wonder. It was as though his own ghost had appeared to him. There were men behind him curious to see how he would be affected. He leaped back with such force as to tumble"
883,e,"to him, and he pitied him for his disappointment, knowing how he himself would feel were his plans to be set aside.So Gormez, the Portuguese, was made the pilot of the Antonio.Magellan, had he reflected, must have seen that this man would carry with him envy and jealousy, passions that are poisons. But Estefano, or Esteban, or Stephen Gormez, took his place at the pilot house of the Antonio to follow the lantern of Magellan, but the hurt in his heart at being superseded never healed.On the ships also was one Juan de Carthagena, captain of the Concepcion, a spy, and one of the ""malapots"" of the expedition. He was called the reedor, or inspector. He inspected Magellan, and Magellan inspected him, as we shall see.And now the flags arose in the clear air, and the joyful fleet cleared the Guadalquivir and leaped into the arms of the open sea,"
884,e,"said by signs.He kissed it again.He knew that he would soon die.""Make me a Christian,"" he said.They named him ""Paul,"" and baptized him.One day found him dead, and they cast his great frame into the sea. He was probably the first convert to the faith among Patagonians, and his so-called [107] conversion was the heart's cry in helplessness.The other giant may have lived to see the days of famine, when men shrank and death threatened all. Then he, too, famished and died, and found a grave in the sea. Another account, makes this giant die on the Antonio before that ship went back to St. Julian.Two islands only appeared in the months of steady sailing. They were uninhabited except by birds. The sky in all this time brought no storm.In these days of ocean solitude, hunger, and death, Magellan was sure always of the faith of two true hearts—the susceptible"

Magellan dead, Del Cano yet lives, and the Italian historian has other scenes to record.The farol of Magellan will go on; it will never cease to shine, and the cast-out name of the Christian Knight will become a fixed star amid the lights that have inspired the world.[144]The massacre at Matan caused the Spaniards to lose credit in the eyes of the natives. The King of Seba turned against them, thus throwing a shadow on the glory of Magellan's missionary work. The Spaniards were, however, much to blame for the change that took place in the King's heart.Their ships were becoming unseaworthy.They were reduced to two ships, the Victoria and the Trinidad, and these shaped"

It would hold light long, and carry it strongly and steadily.""All the ships must have these new farols,"" said he, ""and I must teach you how to signal by them.""He stood up.

Its Urasian destiny was seen in the alliance between Europe and Asia concluded at Canton (1634) between the East India Company and the Chinese Government. It then became the vantage ground of the Anglo-Saxon race. The early English Governors of Hong Kong made the port the cradle of liberty and free trade, and a civilizing influence in the East.[204]The island is some nine miles long and from two to six miles broad, with a population of more than one hundred and twenty thousand, most of whom are Chinese.

It became the purpose of the more fiery patriots to ""drive the Spaniards into the sea.""Aguinaldo advocated the acceptance of concessions [199] by the Spanish Government, by which the rights of the native races should be recognized and protected. His policy was accepted, and the insurgents disbanded. He received Spanish gold to abandon the war for independence, and fell under the suspicion that his patriotism was purchasable. This suspicion has shadowed his fame. He went to Hong Kong.The island Hong Kong, which is English, is a school of good government. Here Aguinaldo seems to have conceived an ambition to free the native races of the archipelago, and form a republic of the confederated islands. The Spanish-American War revealed to him an opportunity to strike for liberty. He said to the Filipinos: ""The hour has"

I sent every man to his post, and remained alone on the open ground, two hundred paces from the edge of the forest, awaiting a foe who would assuredly show me no mercy if I missed him.""That is certainly a solemn moment in which one finds himself placed thus between life and death, all depending on the goodness of a gun, and on the steadiness of the hand that grasps it. I quietly waited. When all had taken up their positions, two men entered the forest, having previously stripped off a part of their clothes, the better to climb the trees in case of need. They were armed only with cutlasses, and accompanied by dogs. For more than half an hour a mournful silence reigned. We listened with all our ears, but no sound was heard.""The buffalo is often very long"

The accidents occasioned by these caymans are frequent and terrible, and I have seen more than one Indian fall victims to them.""At the period of my purchase the only human inhabitants of Jala-Jala were a few Indians, of Malay extraction, who lived in the woods and tilled some nooks of land."

The noise of his headlong career was to be compared only to the gallop of several horses, or to the rush of some monstrous and fantastical creature; it was like the approach of an avalanche. At that moment, I confess, my emotion was so great that my heart beat with extraordinary rapidity. Was it death, a terrible death, that thus approached me? Suddenly the buffalo appeared. He stood for a moment, glared wildly about him, snuffed the air of the plain, and then, his nostrils elevated, his horns thrown back upon his shoulders, charged down upon me with terrible fury.""The decisive moment had come.

The Crown must appeal to Magellan to withdraw from it. The King must ask young King Charles to dismiss Magellan as an act of royal courtesy. If these efforts were not successful, it was argued that the expedition must be arrested by force, or Magellan must be murdered by secret spies of the court.The fleet preparing was to consist of five ships with ample equipment. These were named the Trinidad, the San Antonio, of one hundred and twenty Spanish tons each; the Concepcion, of ninety Spanish tons; the Victoria, of eighty-five tons; and the Santiago, of seventy-five.

This chief had declared with native spirit that Matan would never submit to the Spanish King.""But I can overthrow Silapalapa,"" ran the Matan chief's message, ""if I can have your help. Send me a boatload of men.

It was good news, indeed, when a captain with a cargo of teas was informed by his owners, who may have met him upon the completion of a two years' cruise, that the price of tea had advanced the day before his arrival.

It may have been by the direction of Charles, for his imprisonment implies doubt; otherwise with such an array of testimony against him, we might expect he would have been executed.Two years had passed over beautiful Seville, and the India House there must have began to doubt the story of Gormez as not one of the other ships returned.

I also had a hut built, and put an Indian to live in it, whose duty was to keep constant watch and to let me know as soon as the cayman returned to the river. He watched in vain for upward of two months; but at the end of that time he came and told me that the monster had seized a horse and dragged it into the river to devour it at leisure.

From Saragoca, Tuesday night, the 28th day of September. Court intrigue against Magellan did not avail. There was one thing statecraft could do. It could set spies on Magellan on board his own ships. This it succeeded in doing.There was in Spain at this time a Portuguese adventurer and navigator by the name of Estevan or Esteban Gormez—Stephen Gormez.He was a student of navigation, and was restless to follow the examples of Columbus and Vasco [49] da Gama. He had applied to the court of Spain—probably to Cardinal Ximenes, for a"

So hungry were the crews that one of the sick men begged that if any of the natives were killed human flesh might be brought him.But the natives here were not only wild men, they were robbers; they sought to kill the voyagers and to steal everything. Hence, Magellan called the islands the Ladrones (robbers).The robbers threw stones at the famishing mariners as the ships turned away in search of more hospitable shores. The women were dressed in bark.The ships moved on into unknown seas.On Saturday, March 16, 1521, a notable sight appeared in the dawn of the morning. It was a high bluff, some three hundred leagues distant from the Thieves' Islands. The island was named Zamal, now called Samar.Magellan saw another island near. It was inhabited [109] by a"

Finding that the Admiral was bent on conducting his own expedition, he began to act sullenly, and to disobey orders.Again the captain of the San Antonio demanded of Magellan that he should communicate his orders in regard to the course of steerage to him. He did this by virtue of his office as inspector. He showed a very haughty and disloyal spirit, and if this were not to be checked, the success of the expedition would be imperilled.

They threw at him lances pointed with iron.Magellan, seeing that the odds were against him in such a contest, sought to break their lines by firing their houses.

""Leaving Seville I repaired to Valladolid, where I presented his sacred Majesty, Don Carlos, neither gold nor silver, but other things far more precious in the eyes of so great a sovereign. For I brought to him, among other things, a book written in my own hand, giving an account of all the things which had happened day by day on the voyage.""Then I went to Portugal, where I related to King John the things that I had seen.""Returning by the way of Spain, I came to France, where I presented treasures that I had brought home to the regent mother of the"

In this tree, which might have shaded a hill, lived a colony of birds, with wings like clouds, so broad and powerful that they could lift an elephant or a buffalo into the air and bear him away to the mountainous tree. The fruit of this tree was larger than the largest melons.There were Moors on the ship where this story of the great tree and the great bird was told. One"

The United States in the middle of the century began to trade at Canton from the ports of Boston and Salem.

It shows how small may be the real meaning of pompous and pretentious ceremonies. The rites took place in the Philippines.Says Pigafetta in his narrative prepared for the Grand Master of the Knight of Rhodes:""Since I have spoken of the idols, it may please your illustrious Highness to have an account of the [162] ceremony with which, in this island, they bless the pig.

The people at Manila had given me the most dismal account of [215] the district; according to them, I should soon be murdered: my turn for adventure was such, that all their stories, instead of alarming me, only increased my desire to visit men who were living almost in a savage state.""As soon as I had bought Jala-Jala, I traced for myself a plan of conduct, having for its object to attract the banditti to me; to this end, I felt that"

His own country, Portugal, would not listen to his projects at the time that he offered them to the court; so, like Columbus, Vespucci, and Cabot, he sought the favor of another country. Nothing could stand before the high purpose of his soul. ""If not by Portugal, then by Spain,"" he said to an intimate friend; meaning that, if his own country denied him the favor of giving him an opportunity for exploration, he would present his cause to the court of Spain, which he did.This man, whose real name was Fernao de Magalhaes, was born about the year 1480, at Sabrosa, in Portugal, a wintry district where the hardy soil and the ""gloomy grandeur"" of"

We called out for mercy.""Nobody expected to escape from the storm.""It is to be noted that all and as many times as the light which represents St. Anseline shows itself upon a vessel which is in a storm at sea, that vessel never is lost.""As soon as this light had departed the sea grew calmer and the wings of divers kinds of birds appeared.""Beneficent St. Anseline who manifested his presence by illuminations in the mast and spars in equatorial waters!

All are near to each other, but small and rather narrow.""The world to-day thinks little of spices, for commerce has made common the luxuries of the Indian Ocean. Cloves, nutmegs, allspice, cinnamon, ginger are found in every home in all civilized lands, and even children make few inquiries about them.This was not so in the early days of the Viceroys of India. Spices which were gathered and sold by Arabian merchants, were held in Europe as a gift of Arabia, and esteemed to be the greatest, or among the greatest of luxuries. A ship laden with spices was hailed"

Faleiro was a Portuguese who, like Magellan, was out of favor with the court. He was an astronomer, a geographer, and an astrologer. He had a fiery and impulsive temper, but with it a passion for discovery, and so was drawn into Magellan's heart by gravitation. The two journeyed together, studied together, and [11] started at about the same time for Spain. At Seville they met in a club of famous discoverers, students, and refugees.They had one vision in common, that there was a short route to the Moluccas by the way of the West. The route was not what they dreamed it to be; but there was a new way to the Spice Islands by the West and East, a way that probably no voyager from"
976,e,"everywhere appeared. So amid awful chasms of the sea, now white with snows, now dark with shadows, the little fleet glided on, the farol in the air at night, and all eyes strained with wonder to see what new disclosure this strait would bring. [98]What must have been the reflection of Magellan as the mysteries of the new world lifted before his eyes?Joy is the compensation of suffering, and if his happiness was as great as his trials had been, he must have indeed known thrilling moments. He had dared, and he had achieved.He wondered at the fate of the Antonio, as the days went by. He indeed thought her lost, but yet hoped that she might appear.""She has deserted us,"" ventured a loyal officer.""No,"" reasoned the Admiral. ""Mesquita would never desert me.""He was right. There were many true hearts that made the voyage like Del Cano's, but no heart"

On approaching the spot whence they proceeded we almost invariably found a wild boar, about whose body a boa had twisted its folds, and was gradually hoisting him up into the tree round which it had coiled itself. (See book for illustration.)""When the wild boar had reached a certain height the snake pressed him against the tree with [224] a force that crushed his bones and stifled him. Then the boa let its prey fall, descended the tree, and prepared to swallow what it had slain. This last operation was much too lengthy for us to await its end.""To simplify matters, I sent a ball into the boa's head. Then my Indian took the flesh to dry (bucanier) it, and the skin for dagger sheaths. It is unnecessary to say that the"

They ate them all—a fearful feast!Our voyagers probably had no desire to go too far inland in view of such a warning; so they returned and proceeded on their course toward the antarctic pole.They discovered two small islands, which had more agreeable inhabitants than the land of Cape St. Mary. ""These islands,"" says our good Knight Pigafetta, ""were full of geese and goslings and sea wolves."" He adds: ""We loaded five ships with them for an hour.""The Knight has also left us the following curious picture of the birds, which must have [78] been very much surprised at being so rudely disturbed:""The geese are black, and have feathers all over the body of the same size and shape; and they do not fly but live on fish, and they were so fat that we did not pluck"

The simple record of his adventures is in itself a storybook.Magellan, from his usually high and unselfish character, as well as for the lasting influence of what he did as shown in the new developments of civilization, merits a place among household heroes; and it is in this purpose and spirit I have undertaken a simple sympathetic interpretation of his most noble and fruitful life. I have tried to put into the form of a story the events whose harvests now appear after nearly four hundred years, and to picture truthfully a beautiful and inspiring character. To the narrative of his lone lantern I have"

This last touch gives us a very favorable view of this young giant.But on being conducted away, one of the two [86] giants who were to be liberated, untied his hands and escaped. As soon as he found that he was free, his feet were picked up nimbly indeed. He flew, as it were, his long strides leaving his late captors far behind him. He had no heart to trust Europeans again. He rushed to his native town, but he found only the women there, who must have been greatly alarmed; the men had gone"

Here are the parks, the bull ring, and the lovely botanical gardens.Commercial Manila is a city of coolies, who bare [187] their backs to the sun, though little work can be done here in the noonday heat.Some years ago a terrible cold came to Manila. It was on a late December night, near morning. The thermometer went down to 74°. Think of that, and of the poor coolies, and of the negritos, or the little black dwarfs, and of those who lived in the thousands of huts of bamboo or reeds! True, 74° would indicate a hot day in our American June or July, but in Manila it was a cold morning, and the people came shivering into the streets, to tell each other of their sufferings.The"

""Before the mass began the Captain threw a quantity of musk-rose water on those two Kings,"" is the picture drawn by the Italian, ""and when the offertory of the mass came, the two Kings went to kiss the Cross like us, but they offered nothing, and at the elevation of the body of our Lord they were kneeling like us, and adored our Lord with joined hands.

He has started considerable fortifications in various [192] parts of the city, very large barracks, dykes at the mouth of the river, a powder-mill, smelting furnaces and forges to work the iron mines, and a number of other useful works, which might have succeeded better had they been started in due succession.""The Philippine Archipelago contains fourteen principal islands, the Government of which is divided into twenty-seven provinces, which are governed by alcaldes under the orders of the Governor Captain General. All these islands are thickly populated, being about three million. These islands extend from the tenth to the twenty-third degree north latitude, and vary in breadth from about forty leagues at the north end of Luzon up to two"

The islands lying between Luzon and Mendanao are called the Bissayas, of which Samar has an area of thirteen thousand and twenty miles. Magellan visited Mendanao and then sailed for Zebu, a small island where the first Spanish settlement was made, before Manila, which was founded in 1581.This archipelago was a new world of wonder. The small islands are now computed to number fourteen hundred. Magellan never knew the extent of his discovery.Here he was to find the happiest days of his life, after the serene but famishing voyage. [110]The people here were to receive him with open arms; to feast him; to raise his expectations and to bow down before the Cross. We must describe in detail—thanks to the Italian who was true"

He was buried in a splendid tomb, and the pupils of his school of cosmography and navigation continued to penetrate the ocean farther and farther to the South and West. Vasco da Gama opened the ocean ways to India, and the two great navigators, Columbus and Magellan, owed much to the spirit of the Prince who left courts that he might found a school amid the sea desolations of St. Vincent, in order to inspire young sailors to venture always ""Farther!"" and ""Farther yet!""[19]We must here tell you something of Vasco da Gama, in order that you may better understand the plan and purpose of Magellan.Take your map of the world.

I waited for him to speak; not without a certain degree of anxiety as to what his answer would be.""'Master!' he at last exclaimed, offering me his hand and putting one knee to the ground, 'I will be faithful to you until death!'""I was very well pleased with this reply, but I concealed my satisfaction.""''Tis good,' I said; 'to show you that I have confidence in you, take this weapon, and use it only against enemies.'""I presented him with a Tagal sabre, on which was inscribed in Spanish: 'Draw me not without cause, nor sheath me"

All depended upon the first impressions I should make upon these Indians, now my vassals. On landing, I went straight to a little hamlet, composed of a few cabins.""My faithful coachman was with me; we were each of us armed with a good double-barreled gun, a brace of pistols, and a saber.

He said:""His cousin, Mesquita, our captain, advised these crimes, and so we put him in irons, and have brought him back to receive justice in Spain.""Mesquita protested his innocence and tried to gain credence for his case. But no one cared to listen to him. The court and the popular feeling were against him. He was consigned to a prison.

Before the passage to India was discovered by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, the trade between Asia and Europe was carried on in this manner: There was a great commercial city on the southern coast of Arabia (Arabia Felix) called Alda, or Port Alda. It was a city of merchants. To this port came the ships from the East—China, Japan, India—laden with gold, silk, and spices. The merchants of Alda carried these goods to the Port of Suez on the Red Sea. Thence the merchandise was conveyed"

Thence the merchandise was conveyed on camels to the Nile and to Alexandria, Egypt, and thence by ships to the ports of the Mediterranean.Vasco da Gama discovered a new way to India by doubling the Cape of Good Hope, and when he returned from that voyage all Europe rang with his praise. His discovery of the way to India from the Mediterranean by rounding Africa was one of the most momentous ever made. Vasco da Gama holds rank with Columbus in the unveiling of the mysteries of the ocean world.King John the Navigator had heard such wonderful tales of India that he wished to find a way there by water. He accordingly sent one Bartholomeu Diaz on an expedition with this end in view. [20] Diaz did not find"
